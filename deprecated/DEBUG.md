Debugging models steps

Take peice of paper and write down what want to achieve
What data will help verify this, think visually, and also note down all the simple, invariants checks that must be true


Read the entire code, path checking all invariant checks (scaffolding)
Then verify everything all the way through!


Steps to avoid. Result looks funny, not what you expect!!

1. Check all critical invariants in the code through the debugger! - right model being loaded? Right setting being set? Are we sure? Can we do quick hack tests to check this?!
