Idea; Iterate all possible turnings of the maze, then keep track of how they went. Then feed this back into the prompt there.

Could even generalize this for refinement.

Could even train a human evaluator model to evaluate all possible cases.

System: You are an AI agent. You are exploring a maze. Your objective is to achieve the highest reward possible in an episode. Episode lengths are maximum of 100 steps, unless the maze is completed.
Episode statistics: Trajectory step 50, Episode reward -10
State: Location (5,6)
Possible vector translation actions: Up (0,1), Right (1,0)
Decided action: Right
What is the new state and episode statistics?


Higher level agent:

Possible actions: Left (0.5), Right (0.6), Up (0.8), Down (0.2)
