User Registration and Authentication System Design:

1. User Registration:
- Users should be able to sign up using their email address.
- The system should verify the email address before creating the account.
- Users should be able to set a password during registration.
- The system should store the password securely.

2. User Authentication:
- Users should be able to log in using their email address and password.
- The system should verify the email address and password before granting access.

3. Password Recovery:
- Users should be able to recover their password if they forget it.
- The system should verify the user's identity before allowing password recovery.
- The system should send a password recovery link to the user's email address.
