Contact Management System Design:

1. Block/Unblock Contacts:
- Users should be able to block and unblock other users.
- The system should prevent blocked users from sending messages to the user who blocked them.

2. Create, Edit, and Manage Groups:
- Users should be able to create groups with other users as participants.
- Users should be able to add and remove participants from their groups.
- Users should be able to edit the name and picture of their groups.
