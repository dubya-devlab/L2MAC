The Global Chat Service (GCS) has been successfully designed and implemented with the following features:

- User registration and authentication
- User profiles
- Contact management
- Messaging
- Group chats
- Status/story feature
- Connectivity and offline mode

The implementation for the web application version of the GCS is missing and should be added in future improvements.
