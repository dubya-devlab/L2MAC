up the basic structure of the application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The database should have tables for users, messages, groups, and statuses. Each table should be a dictionary where the key is the id of the item and the value is another dictionary representing the item's data. Write tests to ensure that the database can correctly store and retrieve data.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating endpoints for signing up and logging in. The sign-up endpoint should take an email and password, create a new user in the database, and return a success message. The login endpoint should take an email and password, check if a user with that email and password exists in the database, and return a success message if it does, or an error message if it doesn't. Also, implement a forgotten password recovery feature. This can be a simple endpoint that takes an email and returns a success message, without actually doing anything, since we can't send emails in this environment. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work correctly.", "Step 3: Implement user profiles. This includes creating endpoints for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for setting privacy settings. The profile picture and status message endpoints should take a user id and the new picture or message, update the user's data in the database, and return a success message. The privacy settings endpoint should take a user id and the new settings, update the user's data in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work correctly.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating endpoints for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block and unblock endpoints should take two user ids, update the first user's data in the database to add or remove the second user from their blocked contacts, and return a success message. The group endpoints should take a user id and the group data, update the groups table in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work correctly.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating endpoints for sending and receiving messages, for setting read receipts, and for sending images. The send message endpoint should take a sender id, a receiver id, and the message, update the messages table in the database, and return a success message. The read receipt endpoint should take a message id and a user id, update the message's data in the database to mark it as read by that user, and return a success message. The send image endpoint should take a sender id, a receiver id, and the image, update the messages table in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work correctly.", "Step 6: Implement group chats. This includes creating endpoints for creating groups, for adding and removing participants, and for setting admin roles and permissions. The create group endpoint should take a user id and the group data, update the groups table in the database, and return a success message. The add and remove participants endpoints should take a group id and a user id, update the group's data in the database to add or remove the user, and return a success message. The admin roles endpoint should take a group id and the new roles, update the group's data in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating endpoints for posting statuses and for setting who can see them. The post status endpoint should take a user id and the status data, update the statuses table in the database, and return a success message. The visibility endpoint should take a status id and the new visibility settings, update the status's data in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a simple HTML page that can be served by the Flask application. The page should have forms for all the actions that can be performed through the endpoints, and it should use JavaScript to send requests to the endpoints and display the responses. Write tests to ensure that the page is served correctly.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a feature that queues messages when the user is offline and sends them when the user comes online. This can be done by adding a 'status' field to the messages in the database, which can be 'queued', 'sent', or 'received'. The send message endpoint should check the user's status and set the message's status accordingly. Also, create an endpoint for setting the user's online/offline status. Write tests to ensure that the feature works correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire application and make sure that all the requirements have been met. Run all the tests and make sure they pass. If any tests fail, debug the application and fix the issues. Once all the tests pass, the application is ready to be deployed."], "step": "Step 4: Implement contact management.
