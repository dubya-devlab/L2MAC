This includes the main application file (app.py), a file for user management (user.py), a file for message management (message.py), a file for group management (group.py), and a file for status management (status.py). Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that all the files exist and can be imported correctly.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating a User class in the user.py file with methods for signing up and password recovery. The User class should also have attributes for email, password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a user can sign up, recover their password, and that the User class behaves as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes adding methods to the User class for setting a profile picture and status message, and for managing privacy settings. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a user can set a profile picture and status message, and manage their privacy settings.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes adding methods to the User class for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a user can block and unblock contacts, and create, edit, and manage groups.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating a Message class in the message.py file with methods for sending and receiving messages, marking messages as read, encrypting and decrypting messages, and sharing images. The Message class should also have attributes for the sender, receiver, content, read status, and encryption status. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that messages can be sent and received, marked as read, encrypted and decrypted, and that images can be shared.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating a Group class in the group.py file with methods for creating a group, adding and removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The Group class should also have attributes for the group name, picture, participants, and admins. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a group can be created, participants can be added and removed, and admin roles and permissions can be managed.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes adding methods to the User class for posting a status, setting the visibility of the status, and for viewing the statuses of other users. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a user can post a status, set the visibility of their status, and view the statuses of other users.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes setting up a Flask application in the app.py file, and creating routes for the various features. After implementing the web application, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that the application behaves as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes adding methods to the Message class for queuing messages when the user is offline, and for displaying the online/offline status of a user. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that messages can be queued when a user is offline, and that the online/offline status of a user is displayed correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire codebase to ensure that everything is working as expected. Run all the tests to ensure that they all pass. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues.

Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
