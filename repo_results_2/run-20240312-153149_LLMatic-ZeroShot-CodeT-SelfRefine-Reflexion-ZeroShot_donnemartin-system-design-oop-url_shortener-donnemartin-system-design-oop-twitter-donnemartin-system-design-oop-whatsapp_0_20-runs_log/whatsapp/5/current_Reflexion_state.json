The other features such as profile management, contact management, messaging, group chats, status/story feature, web application, and connectivity/offline mode are not implemented in the generated code.\n\nTo improve the implementation, a new plan could be as follows:\n\n1. Extend the User class to include additional attributes for profile management, such as profile picture, status message, and privacy settings.\n2. Implement endpoints for updating user profile and privacy settings.\n3. Implement a Contact class and endpoints for managing contacts, including blocking and unblocking contacts.\n4. Implement a Message class and endpoints for sending and receiving messages, including read receipts and end-to-end encryption.\n5. Implement a Group class and endpoints for managing group chats, including adding and removing participants and managing admin roles and permissions.\n6. Implement a Status class and endpoints for managing statuses/stories.\n7. Implement a web interface using Flask templates to provide a web-based version of the application.\n8. Implement functionality for handling offline mode, such as message queuing and displaying online/offline status.\n\nThis plan should be executed iteratively, starting with the extension of the User class and the implementation of the corresponding endpoints. After each iteration, tests should be written and run to ensure the newly implemented functionality works as expected.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests.
