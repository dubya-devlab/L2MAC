This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up the Flask framework. The app.py file will serve as the entry point for the application. It will import and use the Flask framework to set up the application and define the routes for the different functionalities. Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies for the project. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication system. This includes creating the User class with attributes such as email and password, and methods for signing up and password recovery. The sign-up method should take an email and password, create a new User instance, and store it in a mock database. The password recovery method should take an email, check if a User with that email exists, and if so, return a password recovery link. After implementing this, write tests to ensure that the sign-up and password recovery methods work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile functionality. This includes adding attributes to the User class for the profile picture and status message, and methods for setting these attributes. The privacy settings can be implemented as a dictionary attribute, with keys for different settings (e.g., 'last seen', 'profile picture') and values indicating who can see them (e.g., 'everyone', 'contacts only', 'no one'). After implementing this, write tests to ensure that the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings can be set and retrieved correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management functionality. This includes creating a Contact class with attributes for the contact's email and blocked status, and methods for blocking and unblocking the contact. The User class should also have a method for creating, editing, and managing groups, which can be represented as lists of Contacts. After implementing this, write tests to ensure that contacts can be blocked and unblocked, and that groups can be created, edited, and managed correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging functionality. This includes creating a Message class with attributes for the sender, receiver, content, read receipt status, and encryption status. The User class should have methods for sending and receiving messages, which should create Message instances and store them in a mock database. The Message class should also have a method for encrypting the content. After implementing this, write tests to ensure that messages can be sent, received, and encrypted correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat functionality. This includes adding methods to the User class for creating a group chat, adding or removing participants, and setting admin roles and permissions. The Group Chat can be represented as a subclass of the Contact class, with additional attributes for the name, picture, participants, and admin roles. After implementing this, write tests to ensure that group chats can be created, participants can be added or removed, and admin roles and permissions can be set correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes adding methods to the User class for posting a status, which should create a Status instance and store it in a mock database. The Status class should have attributes for the content, visibility settings, and expiration time. After implementing this, write tests to ensure that statuses can be posted and retrieved correctly, and that they expire after the correct amount of time.", "Step 8: Implement the web application functionality. This includes setting up the routes in the app.py file for the different functionalities, and creating HTML templates for the different pages. The Flask framework should be used to serve the web application. After implementing this, write tests to ensure that the web application can be accessed and navigated correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode functionality. This includes adding a 'online' attribute to the User class, and methods for going online and offline. When a user is offline, messages they send should be queued and sent when they go online. After implementing this, write tests to ensure that the online/offline status can be set and retrieved correctly, and that messages are queued and sent correctly when a user is offline.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire system. This includes running all the tests written in the previous steps, and writing additional tests if necessary to cover all functionalities. Ensure that all tests pass and that the application works as expected. If any tests fail, debug the corresponding code and fix the issues until all tests pass."], "step": "Step 5: Implement the messaging functionality.
