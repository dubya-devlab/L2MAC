This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. This dictionary should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. At this stage, also set up the basic routes for the application such as the home page and user registration page. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and the routes are working as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating a registration form where users can sign up using their email and password. Also, implement a login form where users can log in using their email and password. For the forgotten password recovery feature, create a form where users can enter their email to receive a password reset link. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the registration, login, and password recovery features are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating a form where users can set their profile picture and status message. Also, implement privacy settings where users can choose who can see their details or last seen status. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings features are working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating a feature where users can block or unblock contacts. Also, implement a feature where users can create, edit, and manage groups. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the block/unblock contacts and group management features are working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating a feature where users can send and receive real-time text messages. Also, implement a feature where users can see message read receipts. For the end-to-end encryption feature, use a simple encryption algorithm to encrypt the messages. Also, implement a feature where users can share images and use emojis, GIFs, and stickers. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the messaging features are working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating a feature where users can create group chats with a name and picture. Also, implement a feature where users can add or remove participants from the group chat. For the admin roles and permissions feature, create a simple role-based access control where the creator of the group chat is the admin and can assign admin roles to other participants. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the group chat features are working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating a feature where users can post image statuses visible for a limited time. Also, implement a feature where users can control who can see their status. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the status/story features are working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a web-based version of the chat application that is accessible from browsers. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the web application is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a feature where messages are queued when the user is offline and are sent once connectivity is restored. Also, implement a feature where the online/offline status of the user is displayed. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features are working correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application. This includes testing all the features together to ensure that they are working correctly in conjunction with each other. Also, perform stress testing to ensure that the application can handle a large number of users and messages. After performing the comprehensive testing, fix any bugs or issues that are found and retest the application to ensure that all the features are working correctly."], "step": "Step 4: Implement the contact management features.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
