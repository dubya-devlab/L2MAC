This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'mock_db.py' file to simulate a database using an in-memory dictionary. This file should include functions to add, update, delete, and retrieve data. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database functions work as expected.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for user registration (sign up) and forgotten password recovery. The sign-up route should accept user details (including email and password), validate them, and store them in the mock database. The forgotten password recovery route should accept an email, validate it, and return a password reset link. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes work as expected and that user details are correctly stored in the mock database.", "Step 3: Implement user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept a user ID and the new picture or message, validate them, and update the user's details in the mock database. The privacy settings route should accept a user ID and the new settings, validate them, and update the user's details in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes work as expected and that user details are correctly updated in the mock database.", "Step 4: Implement contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept a user ID and a contact ID, validate them, and update the user's contact list in the mock database. The group routes should accept a user ID and group details, validate them, and update the user's group list in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes work as expected and that user and group details are correctly updated in the mock database.", "Step 5: Implement messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving real-time text messages, updating message read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images, emojis, GIFs, and stickers. The message routes should accept a sender ID, a receiver ID, and a message, validate them, and store the message in the mock database. The read receipt, encryption, and sharing routes should accept a message ID and the necessary details, validate them, and update the message in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes work as expected and that messages are correctly stored and updated in the mock database.", "Step 6: Implement group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats with a name and picture, adding or removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The group chat routes should accept a user ID and group chat details, validate them, and store the group chat in the mock database. The participant and admin routes should accept a group chat ID and the necessary details, validate them, and update the group chat in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes work as expected and that group chats are correctly stored and updated in the mock database.", "Step 7: Implement status/story features. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses visible for a limited time and controlling who can see the status. The status routes should accept a user ID and status details, validate them, and store the status in the mock database. The visibility control route should accept a status ID and the necessary details, validate them, and update the status in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes work as expected and that statuses are correctly stored and updated in the mock database.", "Step 8: Implement web application features. This includes creating a web-based version of the application accessible from browsers. This can be done by creating HTML templates for the different pages of the application and using Flask's render_template function to serve them. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the templates are correctly rendered and that the web application works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a message queuing system for when the user is offline, and displaying online/offline status. The message queuing system can be simulated by storing unsent messages in a separate part of the mock database and sending them when the user comes online. The online/offline status can be determined by checking the last time the user interacted with the application. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the message queuing system and online/offline status display work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive review of the entire application. This includes checking that all routes work as expected, that data is correctly stored and retrieved from the mock database, and that the web application is fully functional. Also, run all tests to ensure that they all pass. If any issues are found, debug and fix them, and then re-run the tests to ensure that the fixes work as expected."], "step": "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for user registration (sign up) and forgotten password recovery. The sign-up route should accept user details (including email and password), validate them, and store them in the mock database.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
