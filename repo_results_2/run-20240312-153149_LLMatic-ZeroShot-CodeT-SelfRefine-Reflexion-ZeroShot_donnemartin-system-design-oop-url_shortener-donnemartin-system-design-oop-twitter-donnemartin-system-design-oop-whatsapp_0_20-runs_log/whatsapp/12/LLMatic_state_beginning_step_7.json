This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'mock_db.py' file to simulate a database using an in-memory dictionary. This file should include functions to add, update, delete, and retrieve data. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database functions are working as expected.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating a User class in a 'user.py' file with attributes such as email, password, and other necessary details. In the 'app.py' file, create routes for user registration and login. The registration route should add a new user to the mock database, while the login route should check the provided credentials against the stored user data. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that user registration and login are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile feature. This includes adding attributes to the User class for profile picture and status message. Also, create routes in 'app.py' for setting and updating these attributes. The privacy settings can be implemented as a dictionary attribute in the User class, with keys for different settings and boolean values indicating the user's preferences. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the user profile features are working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management feature. This includes creating a Contact class in a 'contact.py' file with attributes for the contact's details and a block status. In the 'app.py' file, create routes for blocking and unblocking contacts. Also, create a Group class in a 'group.py' file for managing groups, with methods for creating, editing, and deleting groups. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the contact management features are working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging feature. This includes creating a Message class in a 'message.py' file with attributes for the sender, recipient, content, read status, and encryption status. In the 'app.py' file, create routes for sending and receiving messages. The encryption can be simulated by adding a simple encryption function in the 'message.py' file. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the messaging features are working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat feature. This includes adding methods to the Group class for adding and removing participants, and setting admin roles and permissions. In the 'app.py' file, create routes for these group chat actions. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the group chat features are working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating a Status class in a 'status.py' file with attributes for the user, content, visibility settings, and expiration time. In the 'app.py' file, create routes for posting and viewing statuses. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the status/story features are working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes setting up a basic HTML template for the chat interface and creating routes in 'app.py' for rendering the template. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the web application is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode feature. This includes adding a 'last_online' attribute to the User class and a 'queued_messages' attribute to the Message class. In the 'app.py' file, create routes for checking the online status of a user and for sending queued messages when the user comes online. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features are working correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive review of the entire application. Check that all routes are working correctly and that all features have been implemented as per the requirements. Run all tests to ensure that they all pass. If any tests fail, debug the corresponding code and fix the issues. Once all tests pass, the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "Step 8: Implement the web application feature.
