The test case is failing because the user ID generated during the test does not match the user ID stored in the application. This could be due to the fact that the User class generates a new UUID every time an instance is created, leading to a mismatch when comparing the IDs.\n\nPlan: To mitigate this issue, I will modify the test case for the login function. Instead of creating a new User instance during the test, I will use the register endpoint to create a new user. This way, the user ID stored in the application and the user ID used during the test will match. I will also ensure that the register endpoint is working correctly by adding a test case for it.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
