The other features such as user profile management, contact management, messaging, group chats, status/story feature, web application, and connectivity/offline mode are not implemented in the generated code.\n\nTo improve this, a new plan could be to incrementally add the remaining features, starting with the user profile management. This would involve adding new routes and methods in the Flask application for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. Corresponding dataclass methods would also need to be added to the User class in models.py. After each feature is implemented, appropriate tests should be written to ensure the functionality works as expected. This process would be repeated for each of the remaining features until the entire Global Chat Service is implemented.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests.
