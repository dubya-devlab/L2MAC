This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The database should have tables for users, messages, groups, and statuses. Each table should have appropriate fields according to the data it needs to store. For example, the users table should have fields for email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, and blocked contacts. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database can store and retrieve data correctly.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept an email and password, and store this information in the users table in the database. The forgotten password recovery route should accept an email, verify that this email exists in the users table, and then return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the sign up and forgotten password recovery routes work correctly, and that they interact with the database as expected.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept a user's email and the new profile picture or status message, update the corresponding field in the users table, and then return a success message. The privacy settings route should accept a user's email and the new privacy settings, update the privacy settings field in the users table, and then return a success message. Write tests to ensure that these routes work correctly, and that they interact with the database as expected.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept a user's email and the email of the contact to block or unblock, update the blocked contacts field in the users table, and then return a success message. The group routes should interact with the groups table in the database. Write tests to ensure that these routes work correctly, and that they interact with the database as expected.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, for updating read receipts, and for sharing images. The send and receive routes should interact with the messages table in the database. The read receipts route should accept a message ID and a new read status, update the corresponding field in the messages table, and then return a success message. The image sharing route should accept a message ID and an image, store the image in a suitable format, and then return a success message. Write tests to ensure that these routes work correctly, and that they interact with the database as expected.", "Step 6: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, for adding and removing participants, and for managing admin roles and permissions. The group chat routes should interact with the groups table in the database. Write tests to ensure that these routes work correctly, and that they interact with the database as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and for controlling who can see the status. The status routes should interact with the statuses table in the database. Write tests to ensure that these routes work correctly, and that they interact with the database as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a basic HTML and CSS layout for the application, and setting up routes to serve these static files. Write tests to ensure that these routes work correctly, and that they serve the correct files.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a route for updating a user's online/offline status, and for queuing messages when a user is offline. The online/offline status route should accept a user's email and a new status, update the corresponding field in the users table, and then return a success message. The message queuing route should accept a message, store it in a suitable format, and then return a success message. Write tests to ensure that these routes work correctly, and that they interact with the database as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive review of the entire application.
