This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'mock_db.py' file to simulate a database using an in-memory dictionary. This file should include functions to add, update, delete, and retrieve data. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database functions are working as expected.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for user registration (sign up) and forgotten password recovery. The sign-up route should accept user details (including email and password), validate them, and store them in the mock database. The forgotten password recovery route should accept an email, validate it, and return a password reset link. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that user details are being stored and retrieved correctly from the mock database.", "Step 3: Implement user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept a user ID and the new picture or message, validate them, and update the user's details in the mock database. The privacy settings route should accept a user ID and the new settings, validate them, and update the user's details in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that user details are being updated correctly in the mock database.", "Step 4: Implement contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block/unblock routes should accept a user ID and the ID of the contact to block or unblock, validate them, and update the user's details in the mock database. The group routes should accept a user ID and the details of the group to create or edit, validate them, and update the group details in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that user and group details are being updated correctly in the mock database.", "Step 5: Implement messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving real-time text messages, for updating message read receipts, for encrypting and decrypting messages, and for sharing images. The message routes should accept a sender ID, a recipient ID, and the message, validate them, and store the message in the mock database. The read receipt route should accept a user ID and a message ID, validate them, and update the message's status in the mock database. The encryption and decryption routes should accept a message, encrypt or decrypt it, and return the result. The image sharing route should accept a user ID, a recipient ID, and an image, validate them, and store the image in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that messages and images are being stored and retrieved correctly from the mock database.", "Step 6: Implement group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, for adding or removing participants, and for updating admin roles and permissions. The group chat route should accept a user ID and the details of the group chat to create, validate them, and store the group chat in the mock database. The participant routes should accept a group chat ID and the ID of the participant to add or remove, validate them, and update the group chat's participants in the mock database. The admin route should accept a group chat ID and the details of the admin roles and permissions to update, validate them, and update the group chat's details in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that group chat details are being stored and updated correctly in the mock database.", "Step 7: Implement status/story features. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and for updating who can see the status. The status route should accept a user ID and an image, validate them, and store the status in the mock database. The visibility route should accept a user ID and the visibility settings, validate them, and update the user's status visibility in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that statuses are being stored and updated correctly in the mock database.", "Step 8: Implement web application features. This includes creating a web-based version of the application that is accessible from browsers. This can be done by creating HTML templates for the different pages of the application and using Flask's render_template function to render them. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the web application is working correctly and that the HTML templates are being rendered correctly.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a message queuing system for when the user is offline, and displaying the user's online/offline status. The message queuing system can be simulated by storing unsent messages in the mock database and sending them when the user comes online. The online/offline status can be determined by checking the user's last activity time in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the message queuing system is working correctly and that the online/offline status is being displayed correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application. This includes running all the tests written in the previous steps, and also testing the application as a whole to ensure that all the features are working together correctly. If any issues are found, debug and fix them, and then re-run the tests to ensure that the fixes have worked. After all tests have passed, the application can be considered complete."], "step": "Step 3: Implement user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept a user ID and the new picture or message, validate them, and update the user's details in the mock database. The privacy settings route should accept a user ID and the new settings, validate them, and update the user's details in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that user details are being updated correctly in the mock database.", "meta_messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\nObjective: Write code for a large system design task.\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
