Start by setting up the basic structure of the application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The dictionary should have keys as user IDs and values as another dictionary containing user details such as email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the application setup is correct and the 'users' dictionary is functioning as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept user details, generate a unique user ID, and store the details in the 'users' dictionary. The forgotten password recovery route should accept a user ID and send a password reset link to the user's email. Since we can't actually send emails, just simulate this by printing a message. Write tests to ensure that the sign up and password recovery features are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept a user ID and the new picture or message, and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly. The privacy settings route should accept a user ID and the new settings, and update the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the profile features are working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking/unblocking contacts and managing groups. The block/unblock routes should accept a user ID and the contact's user ID, and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly. The group management routes should accept a user ID and the group details, and update the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the contact management features are working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. The message routes should accept a user ID, the recipient's user ID, and the message, and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly. The read receipt and encryption routes should accept a user ID and the message ID, and update the 'users' dictionary. The image sharing route should accept a user ID, the recipient's user ID, and the image, and update the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the messaging features are working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding/removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The group chat routes should accept a user ID and the group details, and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly. The participant and admin routes should accept a user ID, the group ID, and the participant's user ID or admin details, and update the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the group chat features are working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and controlling who can see the status. The status routes should accept a user ID and the status details, and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly. The visibility control route should accept a user ID, the status ID, and the visibility settings, and update the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the status/story feature is working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a route for accessing the application from a browser. The route should return a simple HTML page that displays the user's details, contacts, groups, messages, and statuses. Write tests to ensure that the web application feature is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a route for updating the user's online/offline status and queuing messages when the user is offline. The status update route should accept a user ID and the new status, and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly. The message queuing route should accept a user ID, the recipient's user ID, and the message, and store the message in a 'queue' dictionary if the recipient is offline. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features are working correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire application and make any necessary improvements. This includes optimizing the code, improving error handling, and enhancing security. Also, write comprehensive tests for the entire application to ensure that all features are working together correctly and the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding/removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The group chat routes should accept a user ID and the group details, and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly.
