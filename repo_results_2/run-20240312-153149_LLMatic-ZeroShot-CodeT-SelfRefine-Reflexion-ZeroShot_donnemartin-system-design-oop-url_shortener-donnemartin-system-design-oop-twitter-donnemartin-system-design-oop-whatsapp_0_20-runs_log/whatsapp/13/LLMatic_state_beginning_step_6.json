This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'mock_db.py' file to simulate a database using an in-memory dictionary. This file should include functions to add, update, delete, and retrieve data. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database functions are working as expected.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for user registration (sign up) and forgotten password recovery. The sign-up route should accept user details (including email) and add the user to the mock database. The forgotten password recovery route should simulate sending a password recovery email. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that users are added to the mock database.", "Step 3: Implement user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should update the user's data in the mock database. The privacy settings route should also update the user's data, specifically the settings related to who can see user details or last seen status. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that user data is updated in the mock database.", "Step 4: Implement contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking/unblocking contacts and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block/unblock routes should update the user's data in the mock database. The group management routes should also update the mock database, specifically the data related to groups. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that user and group data is updated in the mock database.", "Step 5: Implement messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving real-time text messages, updating message read receipts, encrypting messages, sharing images, and supporting emojis, GIFs, and stickers. The message-related routes should update the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that message data is updated in the mock database.", "Step 6: Implement group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats with a name and picture, adding or removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The group chat-related routes should update the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that group chat data is updated in the mock database.", "Step 7: Implement status/story features. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses visible for a limited time and controlling who can see the status. The status-related routes should update the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly and that status data is updated in the mock database.", "Step 8: Implement a web-based version of the application. This includes creating a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend that interacts with the Flask backend. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the frontend is working correctly and that it can interact with the backend.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a system for queuing messages when the user is offline and displaying online/offline status. The message queuing system should update the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the system is working correctly and that message and user data is updated in the mock database.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire application to ensure that all features have been implemented correctly. Run all tests to ensure that they pass. If any tests fail, debug the relevant code and fix the issues. Once all tests pass, the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "Step 7: Implement status/story features.
