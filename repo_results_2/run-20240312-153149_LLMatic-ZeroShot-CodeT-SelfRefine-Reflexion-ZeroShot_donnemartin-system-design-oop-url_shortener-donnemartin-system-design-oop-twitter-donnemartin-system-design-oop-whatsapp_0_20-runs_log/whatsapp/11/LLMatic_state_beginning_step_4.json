This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The dictionary should have keys as user IDs and values as another dictionary containing user details such as email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write a function for user registration that takes in user details and adds them to the 'users' dictionary. Also, write a function for user authentication that checks if the entered email and password match the stored values in the 'users' dictionary. After writing these functions, write tests to ensure they are working as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the functionality for forgotten password recovery. This can be done by adding a 'security question' and 'security answer' field to the user details during registration. Write a function that asks the user their security question and checks if their answer matches the stored security answer. If it does, allow the user to reset their password. After implementing this, write tests to ensure the forgotten password recovery function is working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile functionality. This includes allowing users to set profile pictures and status messages, and setting privacy settings for who can see user details or last seen status. Write functions for setting and getting profile pictures and status messages, and for setting and getting privacy settings. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure they are working as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management functionality. This includes allowing users to block and unblock contacts, and create, edit, and manage groups. Write functions for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure they are working as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging functionality. This includes allowing users to send and receive real-time text messages, showing message read receipts, encrypting messages for security, and allowing image sharing, emojis, GIFs, and stickers. Write functions for sending and receiving messages, showing read receipts, encrypting and decrypting messages, and for sending images, emojis, GIFs, and stickers. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure they are working as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the group chats functionality. This includes allowing users to create group chats with a name and picture, and add or remove participants. Also, implement admin roles and permissions. Write functions for creating group chats, adding and removing participants, and for setting and getting admin roles and permissions. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure they are working as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes allowing users to post image statuses visible for a limited time, and controlling who can see the status. Write functions for posting and viewing statuses, and for setting and getting status visibility settings. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure they are working as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application functionality. This includes making the chat application accessible from browsers. Use Flask to create a web interface for the chat application. After implementing this, write tests to ensure the web application is working as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode functionality. This includes queuing messages for when the user is offline and sending them once connectivity is restored, and displaying online/offline status. Write functions for queuing and sending messages, and for setting and getting online/offline status. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure they are working as expected.", "Step 10: After implementing all the functionalities, perform a final round of testing to ensure everything is working as expected. This includes running all the tests written in the previous steps, and also testing the entire application flow from user registration to sending and receiving messages."], "step": "Step 5: Implement the messaging functionality.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
