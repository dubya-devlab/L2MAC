This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The dictionary should have keys as user IDs and values as another dictionary containing user details such as email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and the 'users' dictionary is initialized as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept user details, generate a unique user ID, and store the details in the 'users' dictionary. The forgotten password recovery route should accept a user ID and return the corresponding password from the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the sign up and password recovery routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. These routes should accept a user ID and the new details, and update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the profile update routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking/unblocking contacts and managing groups. The block/unblock routes should accept a user ID and a contact ID, and update the 'blocked contacts' list for the user in the 'users' dictionary. The group management routes should accept a user ID and group details, and update the 'groups' list for the user in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the contact management routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. These routes should accept relevant details and perform the necessary actions. Since we don't have a persistent database, you can simulate these actions by printing messages to the console. Write tests to ensure that the messaging routes work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding/removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. These routes should accept relevant details and update the 'groups' list in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the group chat routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and controlling who can see the status. These routes should accept relevant details and perform the necessary actions. Since we don't have a persistent database, you can simulate these actions by printing messages to the console. Write tests to ensure that the status/story routes work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a basic HTML template for the chat application and setting up routes to render the template. Write tests to ensure that the web application routes work as expected and the HTML template is rendered correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a 'message queue' for each user in the 'users' dictionary to store messages when the user is offline. The online/offline status of a user can be simulated by a boolean flag in the user's details in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the message queuing and online/offline status features work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire application and make any necessary improvements.
