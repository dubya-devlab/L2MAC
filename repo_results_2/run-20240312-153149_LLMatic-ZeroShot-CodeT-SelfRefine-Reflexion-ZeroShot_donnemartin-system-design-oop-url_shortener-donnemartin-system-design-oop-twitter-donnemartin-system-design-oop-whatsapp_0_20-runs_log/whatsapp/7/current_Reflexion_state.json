The Group dataclass had a non-default argument 'admin' following a default argument 'members'. In Python, non-default arguments cannot follow default arguments. This can lead to a TypeError during the execution of the code.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, the non-default argument 'admin' should be placed before the default argument 'members' in the Group dataclass. This will ensure that the arguments are defined in the correct order, preventing the TypeError.\n\nThe new plan is to modify the Group dataclass to place the 'admin' argument before the 'members' argument. This will ensure that the arguments are defined in the correct order, preventing the TypeError. \n\nThe revised code will then be tested to ensure that it functions as expected. If any issues are identified during testing, the code will be revised as necessary until it passes all tests.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\nfrom typing import List\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\nusers = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tname: str\\n\\temail: str\\n\\tpassword: str\\n\\tprofile_picture: str = ''\\n\\tstatus_message: str = ''\\n\\tlast_seen_status: str = 'everyone'\\n\\tblocked_contacts: List[str] = []\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Group:\\n\\tadmin: str\\n\\tname: str\\n\\tmembers: List[str] = []\\n\\n@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])\\ndef register():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = User(**data)\\n\\tusers[user.email] = user\\n\\treturn {'message': 'User registered successfully'}, 201\\n\\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\\ndef login():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users.get(data['email'])\\n\\tif user and user.password == data['password']:\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'Login successful'}, 200\\n\\treturn {'message': 'Invalid email or password'}, 401\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\n\\ndef test_register(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/register', json={'name': 'Test User', 'email': 'test@example.com', 'password': 'password'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'User registered successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_login(client):\\n\\tclient.post('/register', json={'name': 'Test User', 'email': 'test@example.com', 'password': 'password'})\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/login', json={'email': 'test@example.com', 'password': 'password'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'Login successful'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_login_fail(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/login', json={'email': 'test@example.com', 'password': 'wrongpassword'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 401\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'Invalid email or password'}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "name": "write_files"}, "role": "assistant"}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.
