This dictionary should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. At this stage, also set up the basic routes for the application such as the home page and user registration page. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and the routes are working as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating a registration form where users can sign up using their email and password. Also, implement a login form where users can log in using their email and password. The user data should be stored in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the registration and login forms are working correctly and the user data is being stored in the mock database as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the forgotten password recovery feature. This involves creating a form where users can enter their email to recover their password. Once the form is submitted, a temporary password should be generated and sent to the user's email. The user should then be able to use this temporary password to log in and change their password. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the password recovery feature is working as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the user profile features. This includes allowing users to set their profile picture and status message. Also, implement privacy settings where users can control who can see their details or last seen status. The user profile data should be stored in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the user profile features are working correctly and the user profile data is being stored in the mock database as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the contact management features. This includes allowing users to block and unblock contacts. Also, implement a feature where users can create, edit, and manage groups. The contact and group data should be stored in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the contact management features are working correctly and the contact and group data is being stored in the mock database as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the messaging features. This includes allowing users to send and receive real-time text messages, displaying message read receipts, and providing end-to-end encryption for security. Also, implement features for image sharing and support for emojis, GIFs, and stickers. The message data should be stored in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the messaging features are working correctly and the message data is being stored in the mock database as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the group chat features. This includes allowing users to create group chats with a name and picture, and add or remove participants. Also, implement admin roles and permissions for group chats. The group chat data should be stored in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the group chat features are working correctly and the group chat data is being stored in the mock database as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the status/story feature. This includes allowing users to post image statuses visible for a limited time and control who can see the status. The status data should be stored in the mock database. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the status/story feature is working correctly and the status data is being stored in the mock database as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the web application feature. This involves making the chat application accessible from browsers. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the web application is working correctly and can be accessed from different browsers as expected.", "Step 10: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features.
