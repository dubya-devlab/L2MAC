The tests for login and logout are failing because they are expecting a 400 status code when the user is not registered or not logged in, but the current implementation of the application does not check for these conditions and returns a 200 status code instead.\n\nTo mitigate this, the application code should be updated to include checks for whether a user is registered before they can log in, and whether a user is logged in before they can log out. If these conditions are not met, the application should return a 400 status code and an appropriate error message. The tests should then be updated to reflect these changes.\n\nAdditionally, the application currently does not implement many of the features specified in the original task. A new plan could involve systematically implementing each of these features one by one, starting with the simpler ones like forgotten password recovery and user profile settings, and then moving on to more complex features like group chats and status/story feature. For each feature implemented, corresponding tests should be written to ensure the feature works as expected. This will help catch any issues early and ensure the code is robust and reliable.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n
