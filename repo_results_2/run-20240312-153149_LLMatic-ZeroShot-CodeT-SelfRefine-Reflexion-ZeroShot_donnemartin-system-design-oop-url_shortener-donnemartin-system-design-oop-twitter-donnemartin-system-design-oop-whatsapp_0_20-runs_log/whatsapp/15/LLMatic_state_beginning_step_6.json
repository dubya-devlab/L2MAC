This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up the Flask framework. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The database should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. Write tests to ensure that the database can correctly store and retrieve user data.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for user sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept user email and password, and store them in the database. The forgotten password recovery route should allow users to reset their password using their email. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication system works correctly.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept the respective data and update the user's profile in the database. The privacy settings route should allow users to control who can see their details or last seen status. Write tests to ensure that the profile management system works correctly.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should update the user's block list in the database. The group management routes should allow users to create groups, add or remove members, and set group details such as name and picture. Write tests to ensure that the contact management system works correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging system. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving text messages, and for sending and receiving images. The text message route should accept a message and a recipient, and store the message in the recipient's inbox in the database. The image route should accept an image and a recipient, and store the image in the recipient's inbox. Write tests to ensure that the messaging system works correctly.", "Step 6: Implement message read receipts and end-to-end encryption. The read receipts should be updated in the database when a message is read. The encryption should be applied to messages before they are stored in the database, and decryption should be applied when messages are retrieved. Write tests to ensure that the read receipts and encryption systems work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement support for emojis, GIFs, and stickers in messages. This includes updating the messaging routes to accept and store these types of content. Write tests to ensure that the messaging system can correctly handle emojis, GIFs, and stickers.", "Step 8: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding or removing participants, and setting admin roles and permissions. The group chat routes should update the group data in the database. Write tests to ensure that the group chat system works correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses, setting visibility duration, and controlling who can see the status. The status routes should update the user's status in the database. Write tests to ensure that the status/story system works correctly.", "Step 10: Implement the web application and connectivity/offline mode. The web application should be accessible from browsers and should display the user's chats, groups, and statuses. The offline mode should queue messages when the user is offline, and send them when connectivity is restored. Write tests to ensure that the web application and offline mode work correctly."], "step": "Step 7: Implement support for emojis, GIFs, and stickers in messages.
