This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. This dictionary should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database can store and retrieve user data correctly.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for user sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept user email and password, and store this information in the mock database. The forgotten password recovery route should accept user email, generate a temporary password, and update the user's password in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the sign up and forgotten password recovery routes work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept user email and the new profile picture or status message, and update this information in the mock database. The privacy settings route should accept user email and the new privacy settings, and update this information in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings routes work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept user email and the contact's email, and update the user's blocked contacts list in the mock database. The group routes should accept user email and group information, and update the user's groups in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the block, unblock, and group routes work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving real-time text messages, for updating message read receipts, for encrypting and decrypting messages, for sharing images, and for sending emojis, GIFs, and stickers. The message routes should accept user email, recipient email, and message content, and update the user's and recipient's messages in the mock database. The read receipt, encryption, image sharing, and emoji routes should work similarly. Write tests to ensure that the message, read receipt, encryption, image sharing, and emoji routes work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating group chats with a name and picture, for adding or removing participants, and for managing admin roles and permissions. The group chat routes should accept user email, group chat information, and participant emails, and update the user's and participants' group chats in the mock database. The admin roles and permissions routes should work similarly. Write tests to ensure that the group chat, participant, and admin roles and permissions routes work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses visible for a limited time, and for controlling who can see the status. The status routes should accept user email, status content, and visibility settings, and update the user's statuses in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the status and visibility routes work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement web application. This includes creating a web-based version of the application accessible from browsers. This can be done by creating HTML templates for the different pages of the application, and using Flask's render_template function to render these templates. Write tests to ensure that the web application works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a message queuing system for when the user is offline, and displaying online/offline status. The message queuing system can be implemented using a list in the mock database to store messages that are to be sent when the user comes online. The online/offline status can be determined based on the user's last activity time stored in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the message queuing system and online/offline status display work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire application and make sure all routes and features are working as expected. Run all tests to ensure that all parts of the application are functioning correctly. If any tests fail, debug the corresponding part of the application and fix the issue. Once all tests pass, the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "Step 1: Start by setting up the basic structure of the application.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
