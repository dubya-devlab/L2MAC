This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The database should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. Write tests to ensure that the database can correctly store and retrieve user data.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for user sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept user email and password, and store them in the database. The forgotten password recovery route should allow users to reset their password using their email. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication system works correctly.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept the respective data and update the user's profile in the database. The privacy settings route should allow users to control who can see their details or last seen status. Write tests to ensure that the profile management system works correctly.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should update the user's contact list in the database. The group management routes should allow users to create groups, add or remove members, and set group details such as name and picture. Write tests to ensure that the contact management system works correctly.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving text messages, for sending read receipts, and for end-to-end encryption. The message routes should update the conversation history in the database. The read receipt route should update the status of messages in the database. The encryption route should ensure that messages are encrypted before being stored in the database. Write tests to ensure that the messaging system works correctly.", "Step 6: Implement image sharing, emojis, GIFs, and stickers support. This includes creating routes for sending images, emojis, GIFs, and stickers. The image route should accept an image file and update the conversation history in the database. The emoji, GIF, and sticker routes should accept the respective data and update the conversation history in the database. Write tests to ensure that the image sharing and emoji support systems work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding or removing participants, and setting admin roles and permissions. The group chat routes should update the group chat data in the database. The participant management routes should update the member list of the group chat in the database. The admin role routes should update the admin list and permissions of the group chat in the database. Write tests to ensure that the group chat system works correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and for controlling who can see the status. The status route should accept an image file and update the user's status in the database. The status visibility route should update the user's status visibility settings in the database. Write tests to ensure that the status/story feature works correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the web application. This includes creating a web-based version of the chat application that is accessible from browsers. The web application should provide all the features of the chat application, including user registration, profile management, contact management, messaging, group chats, and status/story feature. Write tests to ensure that the web application works correctly.", "Step 10: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a system for message queuing when the user is offline, and for displaying online/offline status. The message queuing system should store messages in a queue when the user is offline, and send them once connectivity is restored. The online/offline status system should update the user's status in the database and display it to other users. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode systems work correctly."], "step": "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept the respective data and update the user's profile in the database. The privacy settings route should allow users to control who can see their details or last seen status.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
