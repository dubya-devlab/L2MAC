necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary dependencies for the project. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and requests (for URL validation). Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain the logic for shortening URLs. This should include a function to generate a unique shortened URL and another function to validate the input URL. The validation function should send a GET request to the input URL and check the response status. If the status is 200, the URL is valid; otherwise, it's not. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening and validation functions work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that takes a shortened URL and redirects to the original URL. This will involve looking up the shortened URL in the in-memory database and finding the corresponding original URL. If the shortened URL is not found in the database, return a 404 error. Write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly and handles errors appropriately.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain the logic for tracking and displaying analytics. This should include functions to record a click event (including the date/time and geographical location) and to retrieve the analytics for a specific shortened URL. The geographical location can be mocked for now. Write tests to ensure that the analytics functions work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain the logic for user account management. This should include functions to create an account, log in, log out, and view the user's shortened URLs. The user data can be stored in the in-memory database. Write tests to ensure that the user account functions work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `admin_dashboard.py` file that will contain the logic for the admin dashboard. This should include functions to view all shortened URLs, delete a URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functions work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the URL expiration feature. Modify the `url_shortener.py` file to include a function to set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. When a shortened URL is accessed, check if it has expired before redirecting. If it has expired, return a 404 error. Write tests to ensure that the URL expiration feature works correctly.", "Step 8: Integrate all the features in the Flask application. In the `app.py` file, add routes for each feature (URL shortening, redirection, analytics, user accounts, admin dashboard, and URL expiration). Each route should call the appropriate function from the corresponding module. Write tests to ensure that all routes work correctly and return the expected results.", "Step 9: Perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application. Use pytest to run all the tests written in the previous steps. Ensure that all tests pass and that the application works as expected. If any test fails, debug the issue and fix the code.", "Step 10: Finally, document the application. Write comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each function and method.
