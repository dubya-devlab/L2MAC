However, it seems that the evaluation metric was expecting a scalar value indicating the proportion of features implemented, but it was not clear what the total number of features was. To mitigate this, I would clarify the total number of features expected in the original specification and then evaluate the proportion of those features that have been implemented in the generated code. This would provide a clear scalar value for the evaluation metric.\n\nPlan:\n1. Start by clearly defining the total number of features expected in the original specification.\n2. Implement each feature one by one, ensuring that each feature is fully functional and tested.\n3. After each feature is implemented, update the scalar value indicating the proportion of features implemented.\n4. Continue this process until all features have been implemented and tested.\n5. Finally, output the scalar value indicating the proportion of features implemented. This will provide a clear evaluation metric for the generated code.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n
