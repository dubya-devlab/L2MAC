Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and requests (for URL validation). Create a `user.py` file for user-related operations, `url.py` for URL shortening and redirection operations, `analytics.py` for analytics-related operations, and `admin.py` for admin-related operations. Lastly, create a `database.py` file to mock a database using an in-memory dictionary. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the files and project structure are correctly set up.", "Step 2: Implement the user account creation feature in the `user.py` file. This will involve creating a User class with attributes such as username, password, and a list of URLs. The User class should also have methods for creating a new user, editing user details, and deleting a user. In the `database.py` file, implement functions for adding a user to the database, retrieving a user, and deleting a user. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that user account creation, editing, and deletion are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the URL shortening feature in the `url.py` file. This will involve creating a URL class with attributes such as the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who created it, and an optional expiration date. The URL class should also have methods for creating a new shortened URL, validating a URL, and generating a unique shortened URL. In the `database.py` file, implement functions for adding a URL to the database, retrieving a URL, and deleting a URL. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that URL shortening, validation, and deletion are working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the redirection feature in the `url.py` file. This will involve creating a function that takes a shortened URL as input and redirects to the original URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the redirection is working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the analytics feature in the `analytics.py` file. This will involve creating an Analytics class with attributes such as the URL, the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. The Analytics class should also have methods for updating the number of clicks and retrieving analytics for a particular URL. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the analytics are being correctly updated and retrieved.", "Step 6: Implement the user account features in the `user.py` file. This will involve creating methods in the User class for viewing all their shortened URLs and viewing analytics for all their shortened URLs. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that users can correctly view all their URLs and their analytics.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard features in the `admin.py` file. This will involve creating an Admin class with methods for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard is working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration feature in the `url.py` file. This will involve adding an attribute for the expiration date/time in the URL class and a method for checking if a URL has expired. In the redirection function, add a check for URL expiration. If a URL has expired, the function should return an error message instead of redirecting. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that URL expiration is working correctly.", "Step 9: Integrate all the features in the `app.py` file. This will involve setting up routes for each feature and calling the appropriate functions from the User, URL, Analytics, and Admin classes. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application is working as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, run all the tests to ensure that all features are working correctly.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
