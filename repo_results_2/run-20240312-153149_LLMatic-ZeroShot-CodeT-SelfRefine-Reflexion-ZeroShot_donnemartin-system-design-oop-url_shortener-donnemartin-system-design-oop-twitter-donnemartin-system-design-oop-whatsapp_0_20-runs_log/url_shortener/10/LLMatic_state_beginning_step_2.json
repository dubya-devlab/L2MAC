Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask application with the necessary files and directories. The main files will include `app.py` (the main application file), `models.py` (for database models), `views.py` (for handling routes and views), `services.py` (for business logic), and `utils.py` (for utility functions). Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the Python packages needed for this project. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and all necessary files are present.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. In the `models.py` file, define a `URL` data class with fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, and the user who created it. In the `services.py` file, create a function to generate a unique shortened URL. This function should take a URL as input, validate it, and return a shortened version. The validation should check that the URL is active and legitimate. If the user chooses a custom short link, check that it is available. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature works correctly.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. In the `views.py` file, create a route that matches the pattern of the shortened URLs. When this route is accessed, it should redirect to the original URL associated with the shortened URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the redirection feature works correctly.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. In the `models.py` file, define a `Click` data class with fields for the URL, the date/time of the click, and the geographical location of the clicker. In the `services.py` file, create a function to record a click when a shortened URL is accessed. Also, create a function to retrieve the statistics for a given URL. This function should return the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of each clicker. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the analytics feature works correctly.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. In the `models.py` file, define a `User` data class with fields for the username, password, and a list of URLs. In the `services.py` file, create functions to create an account, view all URLs for a user, edit a URL, and delete a URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the user accounts feature works correctly.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. In the `views.py` file, create routes for the admin dashboard. These routes should allow administrators to view all URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature works correctly.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. In the `models.py` file, add a field for the expiration date/time to the `URL` data class. In the `services.py` file, modify the function to generate a shortened URL to accept an optional expiration date/time. When a shortened URL is accessed, check if it has expired before redirecting. If it has expired, return an error message instead of redirecting. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the expiration feature works correctly.", "8. After implementing all the features, integrate them in the `app.py` file. This file should import the routes from the `views.py` file and start the Flask application. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application works as a whole.", "9. Perform a final review of the code to ensure that it follows best practices for Python and Flask. This includes checking for consistent indentation, appropriate use of comments, and efficient use of data structures and algorithms. After reviewing the code, write tests to ensure that the code follows best practices.", "10. Finally, write a comprehensive set of tests for the entire application. These tests should cover all the features and edge cases. Run these tests to ensure that all parts of the application work correctly together.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
