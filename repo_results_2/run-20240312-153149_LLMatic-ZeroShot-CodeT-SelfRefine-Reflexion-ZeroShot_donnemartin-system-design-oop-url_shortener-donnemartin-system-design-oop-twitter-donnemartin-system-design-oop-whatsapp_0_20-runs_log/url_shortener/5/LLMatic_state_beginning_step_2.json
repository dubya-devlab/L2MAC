Start by setting up the project structure and necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point for our application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary dependencies for the project. The dependencies will include Flask, pytest for testing, and requests for making HTTP requests to validate URLs. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `Shortener` class in a file named `shortener.py`. This class will have methods for validating URLs, generating short URLs, and storing the mapping between the original and short URLs in an in-memory dictionary. The `Shortener` class should also handle custom short URLs. After implementing the `Shortener` class, write tests to ensure that it can correctly validate URLs, generate unique short URLs, and handle custom short URLs.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. Add a route in the Flask application that matches the pattern of the short URLs. When this route is accessed, the application should use the `Shortener` class to look up the original URL and redirect to it. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that accessing a short URL correctly redirects to the original URL.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. Modify the `Shortener` class to keep track of the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker for each short URL. The geographical location can be determined from the IP address of the request. After implementing the analytics feature, write tests to ensure that the analytics data is correctly recorded and can be retrieved.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `User` class in a file named `user.py`. This class will have methods for creating accounts, viewing all shortened URLs of a user, editing or deleting shortened URLs, and viewing analytics for all shortened URLs. The `User` class should store the user data in an in-memory dictionary. After implementing the `User` class, write tests to ensure that it can correctly handle user accounts and their associated data.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `Admin` class in a file named `admin.py`. This class will inherit from the `User` class and have additional methods for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. After implementing the `Admin` class, write tests to ensure that it can correctly handle admin tasks.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. Modify the `Shortener` class to allow setting an expiration date/time for the shortened URLs. When a short URL is accessed, the application should check if the URL has expired and if so, return an error instead of redirecting. After implementing the expiration feature, write tests to ensure that the expiration of URLs is correctly handled.", "8. Integrate all the features in the Flask application. Add routes for user registration, login, viewing and editing shortened URLs, viewing analytics, and admin tasks. Use the `User`, `Admin`, and `Shortener` classes to handle the requests. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application works as expected.", "9. Implement error handling in the Flask application. Add error handlers for common HTTP errors like 404 and 500. The error handlers should return a user-friendly error message. After implementing error handling, write tests to ensure that the error handlers work correctly.", "10. Finally, review all the code and tests. Make sure that the code follows best practices for Python and Flask, and that all the tests pass. If any issues are found, fix them and rerun the tests. Once all the tests pass, the implementation of the online URL shortening service is complete."], "step": "3. Implement the redirection feature.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
