Start by setting up the project structure. Create a Flask application with the necessary routes for the URL shortening service. The routes should include '/shorten' for shortening URLs, '/' for redirecting shortened URLs to their original URLs, '/analytics' for viewing URL analytics, '/account' for user account related operations, and '/admin' for admin dashboard. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store the data. The data to be stored includes user accounts, shortened URLs, and analytics data. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and the routes are working as expected.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a function that takes a URL as input, validates the URL, and returns a shortened version of the URL. The validation should check if the URL is active and legitimate. The shortened URL should be unique. If a user chooses a custom short link, check if it's available. If it's not available, return an error message. If it's available, use it as the shortened URL. Store the original URL and the shortened URL in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening function is working correctly and handles edge cases, such as invalid URLs and unavailable custom short links.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. When a user accesses a shortened URL, they should be redirected to the original URL. Create a function that takes a shortened URL as input, retrieves the original URL from the mock database, and redirects the user to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection function is working correctly and handles edge cases, such as non-existent shortened URLs.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. Create a function that takes a shortened URL as input and returns statistics about the URL. The statistics should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. Each time a shortened URL is accessed, update the analytics data in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the analytics function is working correctly and handles edge cases, such as non-existent shortened URLs.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Create functions for creating an account, viewing all shortened URLs associated with an account, editing or deleting shortened URLs, and viewing analytics for all shortened URLs. Store the account data in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the account functions are working correctly and handle edge cases, such as non-existent accounts and unauthorized access to account data.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create functions for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. These functions should only be accessible to administrators. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functions are working correctly and handle edge cases, such as unauthorized access.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. Allow users to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. When a user accesses an expired URL, return an error message instead of redirecting to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature is working correctly and handles edge cases, such as accessing a URL after it has expired.", "8. After implementing all the features, perform integration testing. Test the entire system as a whole to ensure that all the features work together seamlessly. Check that the data flows correctly between the different parts of the system and that the system handles edge cases, such as simultaneous requests and high load.", "9. Optimize the system for performance. Identify any bottlenecks in the system and implement solutions to improve performance. This could involve optimizing the data structures used in the mock database, improving the efficiency of the algorithms used in the system, or implementing caching for frequently accessed data. Write tests to ensure that the optimizations do not break any existing functionality and actually improve performance.", "10. Finally, document the system. Write clear and concise comments for all functions and methods. Create a README file that explains how to use the system, including how to set up the system, how to use each feature, and how to run the tests. Also, include a requirements.txt file that lists all the Python packages required to run the system."], "step": "4. Implement the analytics feature.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
