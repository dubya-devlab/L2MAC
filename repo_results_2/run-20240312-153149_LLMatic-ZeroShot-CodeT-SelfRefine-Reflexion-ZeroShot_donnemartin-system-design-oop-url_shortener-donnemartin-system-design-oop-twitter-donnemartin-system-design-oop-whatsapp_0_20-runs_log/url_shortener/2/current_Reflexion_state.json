The other features such as analytics, user accounts, admin dashboard, and expiration were not implemented. This could be due to the complexity of these features and the time constraints. \n\nTo mitigate this, a new plan could be devised that breaks down these features into smaller, manageable tasks. This would allow for a more focused and efficient implementation. For example, the analytics feature could be broken down into tasks such as implementing click tracking, date/time tracking, and geographical location tracking. This approach would make it easier to incrementally add these features to the codebase. \n\nAdditionally, more time could be allocated for testing and debugging to ensure that each feature is working correctly before moving on to the next. This would help prevent issues from accumulating and becoming more difficult to fix later on.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
