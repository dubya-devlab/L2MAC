This includes allowing users to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL, after which the URL will no longer redirect to the original URL.\n\nBy following this plan, the generated code should be able to cover all the original features specified.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, redirect\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\nimport datetime\\nimport random\\nimport string\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n# Mock database\\nurls_db = {}\\nusers_db = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tusername: str\\n\\tpassword: str\\n\\turls: dict\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass URL:\\n\\toriginal_url: str\\n\\tshort_url: str\\n\\texpiration_date: datetime.datetime\\n\\tclicks: int\\n\\tclick_data: list\\n\\n@app.route('/shorten_url', methods=['POST'])\\ndef shorten_url():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\toriginal_url = data['original_url']\\n\\tshort_url = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits, k=5))\\n\\texpiration_date = datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=30)\\n\\turl = URL(original_url, short_url, expiration_date, 0, [])\\n\\turls_db[short_url] = url\\n\\treturn {'short_url': short_url}\\n\\n@app.route('/<short_url>', methods=['GET'])\\ndef redirect_to_url(short_url):\\n\\turl = urls_db.get(short_url)\\n\\tif url and url.expiration_date > datetime.datetime.now():\\n\\t\\turl.clicks += 1\\n\\t\\turl.click_data.append({'click_time': datetime.datetime.now()})\\n\\t\\treturn redirect(url.original_url)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn {'error': 'URL expired or does not exist'}\\n\\n@app.route('/create_user', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_user():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tusername = data['username']\\n\\tpassword = data['password']\\n\\tuser = User(username, password, {})\\n\\tusers_db[username] = user\\n\\treturn {'message': 'User created successfully'}\\n\\n@app.route('/user/<username>/urls', methods=['GET'])\\ndef get_user_urls(username):\\n\\tuser = users_db.get(username)\\n\\tif user:\\n\\t\\treturn {'urls': user.urls}\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn {'error': 'User does not exist'}\\n\\n@app.route('/user/<username>/url/<short_url>', methods=['DELETE'])\\ndef delete_user_url(username, short_url):\\n\\tuser = users_db.get(username)\\n\\tif user and short_url in user.urls:\\n\\t\\tdel user.urls[short_url]\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'URL deleted successfully'}\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn {'error': 'URL does not exist'}\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nimport datetime\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef init_db():\\n\\tapp.urls_db = {}\\n\\tapp.users_db = {}\\n\\n@pytest.mark.usefixtures('init_db')\\ndef test_shorten_url(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/shorten_url', json={'original_url': 'https://www.google.com'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert 'short_url' in response.get_json()\\n\\n@pytest.mark.usefixtures('init_db')\\ndef test_redirect_to_url(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/shorten_url', json={'original_url': 'https://www.google.com'})\\n\\tshort_url = response.get_json()['short_url']\\n\\tresponse = client.get(f'/{short_url}')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 302\\n\\n@pytest.mark.usefixtures('init_db')\\ndef test_create_user(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/create_user', json={'username': 'test', 'password': 'test'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert 'message' in response.get_json()\\n\\n@pytest.mark.usefixtures('init_db')\\ndef test_get_user_urls(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/create_user', json={'username': 'test', 'password': 'test'})\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/user/test/urls')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert 'urls' in response.get_json()\\n\\n@pytest.mark.usefixtures('init_db')\\ndef test_delete_user_url(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/create_user', json={'username': 'test', 'password': 'test'})\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/shorten_url', json={'original_url': 'https://www.google.com'})\\n\\tshort_url = response.get_json()['short_url']\\n\\tapp.users_db['test'].urls[short_url] = app.urls_db[short_url]\\n\\tresponse = client.delete('/user/test/url/' + short_url)\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert 'message' in response.get_json()\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "name": "write_files"}, "role": "assistant"}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"All tests passed.\"}"}]}
