project structure and the necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named 'app.py'. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask for the web framework, pytest for testing, and requests for making HTTP requests to validate URLs. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a 'url_shortener.py' file that will contain a function to generate a unique shortened URL. The function will take a URL as input and return a shortened version of it. The shortened URL can be generated by hashing the original URL and taking a substring of the hash. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly generates unique shortened URLs.", "Step 3: Implement the URL validation feature. In the 'url_shortener.py' file, add a function to validate that a given URL is active and legitimate. The function will make a HTTP request to the URL and check the response status. If the status is 200, the URL is considered valid. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly validates URLs.", "Step 4: Implement the custom short link feature. Modify the URL shortening function to accept an optional parameter for a custom short link. If the custom short link is provided and is not already in use, the function will return it as the shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly handles custom short links.", "Step 5: Implement the redirection feature. In the 'app.py' file, add a route that matches the pattern of the shortened URLs. When a request is made to a shortened URL, the application will redirect to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the analytics feature. Create a 'analytics.py' file that will contain functions to track and retrieve statistics about shortened URLs. The statistics will include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. The geographical location can be determined from the IP address of the request. Write tests to ensure that the analytics functions work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a 'user_accounts.py' file that will contain functions to handle user registration, login, and management of shortened URLs. The functions will allow users to view, edit, and delete their shortened URLs. Write tests to ensure that the user account functions work correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In the 'app.py' file, add routes for the admin dashboard. The dashboard will allow administrators to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functions work correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the expiration feature. Modify the URL shortening function to accept an optional parameter for an expiration date/time. If the expiration date/time is provided, the shortened URL will become inactive after the specified date/time. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature works correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, integrate all the features in the 'app.py' file.
