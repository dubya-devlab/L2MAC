You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data.

Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain the logic for shortening URLs. This will include a function to validate URLs, a function to generate unique shortened URLs, and a function to handle custom short links. The URL validation function will make a GET request to the URL and check the response status. The unique shortened URL generation function will use a simple algorithm to generate a unique string for each URL. The custom short link function will check if the requested custom link is already in use and return it if it's available. Write tests for each of these functions to ensure they work as expected.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that will handle the redirection. This route will take the shortened URL as a parameter, look it up in the in-memory database, and redirect to the original URL if found. If the shortened URL is not found, it should return a 404 error. Write a test to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain the logic for tracking and displaying analytics. This will include a function to track each click on a shortened URL, including the date/time and geographical location of the clicker, and a function to display the analytics for a specific shortened URL. The geographical location can be determined from the IP address of the clicker, using a package like geoip2. Write tests for each of these functions to ensure they work as expected.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain the logic for handling user accounts. This will include functions to create accounts, view all shortened URLs associated with an account, edit or delete shortened URLs, and view analytics for all shortened URLs. The in-memory database will need to be updated to associate shortened URLs with user accounts. Write tests for each of these functions to ensure they work as expected.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create a `admin_dashboard.py` file that will contain the logic for the admin dashboard. This will include functions to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. The system performance can be monitored using a package like psutil. Write tests for each of these functions to ensure they work as expected.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. Update the `url_shortener.py` file to include a function to set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. The in-memory database will need to be updated to store the expiration date/time for each shortened URL. The redirection function in the `app.py` file will need to be updated to check the expiration date/time before redirecting. Write tests for these updates to ensure they work as expected.", "8. Update the Flask application in the `app.py` file to include all the routes for the features implemented. This will include routes for shortening URLs, redirecting, displaying analytics, handling user accounts, the admin dashboard, and setting URL expiration. Write tests for each of these routes to ensure they work as expected.", "9. Perform a final review of the code to ensure it meets all the functional requirements. Run all the tests to ensure they all pass. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues until all tests pass.", "10. Document the code and the API.

Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
