Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and requests (for URL validation). Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain a function to generate a unique shortened URL. The function should take a URL as input and return a shortened version of it. The shortened URL can be generated by hashing the original URL and taking a substring of the hash. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly generates unique shortened URLs.", "Step 3: Implement the URL validation feature. In the `url_shortener.py` file, add a function to validate that a URL is active and legitimate. The function should send a GET request to the URL and check the response status. If the status is 200, the URL is valid. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly validates URLs.", "Step 4: Implement the custom short link feature. Modify the URL shortening function to accept an optional parameter for a custom short link. If the parameter is provided, the function should use it as the shortened URL instead of generating a new one. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly handles custom short links.", "Step 5: Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that matches the pattern of the shortened URLs. When a GET request is made to this route, the application should redirect to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain functions to track and retrieve statistics about shortened URLs. The statistics should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. Write tests to ensure that the analytics functions work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain functions to handle user registration, login, and management of shortened URLs. The functions should allow users to view, edit, and delete their shortened URLs. Write tests to ensure that the user account functions work correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In the `app.py` file, add routes for the admin dashboard. The dashboard should allow administrators to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functions work correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the expiration feature. Modify the URL shortening function to accept an optional parameter for an expiration date/time. If the parameter is provided, the shortened URL should become inactive after the specified date/time. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature works correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, integrate all the features in the `app.py` file. The application should allow users to input a URL, validate the URL, generate a shortened URL, redirect to the original URL when the shortened URL is accessed, track and display analytics, manage user accounts, provide an admin dashboard, and handle URL expiration. Write tests to ensure that all the features work together correctly."], "step": "Step 9: Implement the expiration feature.
