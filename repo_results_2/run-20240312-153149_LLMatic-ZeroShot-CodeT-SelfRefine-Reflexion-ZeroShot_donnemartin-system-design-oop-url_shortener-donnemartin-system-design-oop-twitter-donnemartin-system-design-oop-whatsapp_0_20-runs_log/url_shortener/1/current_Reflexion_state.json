Users can set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL.\n```\n\nThe failure in the previous code generation was due to a type mismatch error in the comparison of the URL expiration date with the current date. The error occurred because the expiration date was not correctly parsed from the JSON request data, resulting in a string being compared with a datetime object.\n\nTo mitigate this, the new plan would be to modify the 'shorten_url' function to correctly parse the expiration date from the request data. This would involve using the 'dateutil.parser' module to parse the date string into a datetime object. Additionally, the unit tests would need to be updated to correctly format the expiration date as an ISO 8601 string when sending the request data. This should ensure that the expiration date is correctly handled and prevent the type mismatch error from occurring.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests.
