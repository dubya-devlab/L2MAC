Start by setting up the project structure and necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point for our application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary dependencies for the project. The dependencies will include Flask, pytest for testing, and requests for making HTTP requests to validate URLs. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `Shortener` class in a file named `shortener.py`. This class will have methods for validating URLs, generating short URLs, and storing the mapping between the original and short URLs in an in-memory dictionary. The `Shortener` class should also handle custom short URLs if provided by the user. After implementing the `Shortener` class, write tests to ensure that it can correctly validate URLs, generate unique short URLs, and store the mappings correctly.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. In the Flask application, add a route that matches the pattern of the short URLs. When this route is accessed, it should use the `Shortener` class to look up the original URL and redirect to it. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that accessing a short URL correctly redirects to the original URL.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. Extend the `Shortener` class to keep track of the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker for each short URL. The geographical location can be determined from the IP address of the request. After implementing the analytics feature, write tests to ensure that it correctly records and retrieves the analytics data.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `User` class in a file named `user.py`. This class will have methods for creating accounts, viewing all the user's shortened URLs, and editing or deleting their shortened URLs. The `User` class should also be able to view analytics for all their shortened URLs. After implementing the `User` class, write tests to ensure that it correctly handles user accounts and their associated data.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `Admin` class in a file named `admin.py`. This class will inherit from the `User` class and have additional methods for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. After implementing the `Admin` class, write tests to ensure that it correctly handles admin tasks.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. Extend the `Shortener` class to allow users to set an expiration date/time for their shortened URLs. When a short URL has expired, it should no longer redirect to the original URL. After implementing the expiration feature, write tests to ensure that it correctly handles URL expiration.", "8. Integrate all the features in the Flask application. The application should provide routes for users to input URLs to be shortened, access their shortened URLs, view analytics, create and manage their accounts, and access the admin dashboard. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application correctly handles all the routes and their associated tasks.", "9. Implement error handling in the Flask application. The application should return appropriate error messages for invalid URLs, non-existent short URLs, expired short URLs, non-existent user accounts, and unauthorized access to the admin dashboard. After implementing error handling, write tests to ensure that the application correctly handles various error conditions.", "10. Finally, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application. Run all the tests written in the previous steps to ensure that all the features work as expected. Also, test the application with a variety of inputs to ensure that it can handle edge cases and unexpected inputs. After performing comprehensive testing, fix any bugs that are found and re-run the tests until all of them pass."], "step": "7. Implement the expiration feature.
