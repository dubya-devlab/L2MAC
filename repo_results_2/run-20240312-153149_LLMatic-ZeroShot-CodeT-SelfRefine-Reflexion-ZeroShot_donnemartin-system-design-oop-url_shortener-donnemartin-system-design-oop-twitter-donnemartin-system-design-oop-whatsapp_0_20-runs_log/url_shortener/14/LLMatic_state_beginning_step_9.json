Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and requests (for URL validation). Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain a function to generate a unique shortened URL. The function will take a URL as input and return a shortened version of it. The shortened URL can be generated by hashing the original URL and taking a substring of the hash. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly generates unique shortened URLs.", "Step 3: Implement the URL validation feature. In the `url_shortener.py` file, add a function to validate that a given URL is active and legitimate. The function can send a GET request to the URL and check the response status. If the status is 200, the URL is valid. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly validates URLs.", "Step 4: Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that takes a shortened URL as a parameter and redirects to the original URL. The route can look up the original URL from a dictionary that maps shortened URLs to original URLs. Write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain functions to track and retrieve statistics about shortened URLs. The statistics can include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. The geographical location can be determined from the IP address of the clicker. Write tests to ensure that the analytics functions work correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain functions to handle user registration, login, and management of shortened URLs. The functions will interact with a dictionary that serves as a mock database of user accounts. Each account can be represented as a dictionary with fields for username, password, and a list of shortened URLs. Write tests to ensure that the user account functions work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In the `app.py` file, add routes for administrators to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. The routes can interact with the dictionaries that serve as mock databases of shortened URLs and user accounts. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functions work correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration feature. In the `url_shortener.py` file, add a function to set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. The function can add an expiration entry to the dictionary that maps shortened URLs to original URLs. The redirection route in the `app.py` file should check the expiration date/time before redirecting. Write tests to ensure that the URL expiration feature works correctly.", "Step 9: Integrate all the features in the `app.py` file. Add routes for users to input a URL to be shortened, choose a custom short link, view statistics about their shortened URLs, and set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. The routes should use the functions from the `url_shortener.py`, `analytics.py`, and `user_accounts.py` files. Write tests to ensure that all the routes work correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, run all the tests using pytest to ensure that all the features work as expected.
