Start by setting up the project structure and necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to manage the project dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and any other necessary libraries. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `Shortener` class in a file named `shortener.py`. This class should have a method `shorten_url` that takes a URL as input and returns a shortened version of the URL. The shortened URL should be unique for each input URL. Also, implement a method `validate_url` that checks if a URL is active and legitimate. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that they work as expected. The tests should check that the `shorten_url` method returns a unique shortened URL for each input and that the `validate_url` method correctly identifies active and legitimate URLs.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. In the Flask application, add a route that matches the pattern of the shortened URLs. When this route is accessed, the application should redirect to the original URL associated with the shortened URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that accessing a shortened URL correctly redirects to the original URL.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. Create an `Analytics` class in a file named `analytics.py`. This class should have methods to track and retrieve statistics about shortened URLs, such as the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that they work as expected. The tests should check that the analytics methods correctly track and retrieve the desired statistics.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `User` class in a file named `user.py`. This class should have methods to create an account, view all shortened URLs associated with an account, edit or delete a shortened URL, and view analytics for all shortened URLs. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that they work as expected. The tests should check that the user methods correctly manage user accounts and their associated URLs and analytics.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `Admin` class in a file named `admin.py`. This class should inherit from the `User` class and have additional methods to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that they work as expected. The tests should check that the admin methods correctly manage the system and its users and URLs.", "7. Implement the URL expiration feature. Add a method `set_expiration` to the `Shortener` class that allows users to set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. After the expiration date/time, the shortened URL should no longer redirect to the original URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that it works as expected. The tests should check that a shortened URL expires correctly and no longer redirects after its expiration date/time.", "8. Integrate all the features in the Flask application. The application should provide routes for users to input a URL to be shortened, choose a custom short link, view statistics about their shortened URLs, create an account, view all their shortened URLs, edit or delete their shortened URLs, and set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. Administrators should also be able to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application works as a whole. The tests should check that all routes and features function correctly together.", "9.

You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}], "message_hash": "e46a4d495f54be9cc02e8d3fe87c232dccb25e94776edf777f4c584bd2763b17"}
