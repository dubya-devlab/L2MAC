Users can input a URL to be shortened.\n   - [ ] 1.2. The system validates that the URL is active and legitimate.\n   - [ ] 1.3. The system generates a unique shortened URL.\n   - [ ] 1.4.

Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 3.2. View number of clicks.\n   - [ ] 3.3. View date/time of each click.\n   - [ ] 3.4. View geographical location of the clicker.\n\n4. **User Accounts**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can create accounts.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Account holders can view all their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Account holders can edit or delete their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.4. Account holders can view analytics for all their shortened URLs.\n\n5. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Administrators can view all shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Administrators can delete any URL or user account.\n   - [ ] 5.3. Administrators can monitor system performance and analytics.\n\n6. **Expiration**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Users can set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL.\n```\n\nThe generated code failed to run successfully due to a missing module 'geopy'. This module was not included in the requirements.txt file, which led to an ImportError when the tests were run. \n\nTo mitigate this issue, I need to ensure that all necessary dependencies are included in the requirements.txt file. This includes not only the main packages used in the code (flask, pytest, dataclasses), but also any additional packages needed for specific features, such as 'geopy' for geographical location tracking.\n\nIn addition, the code only partially implemented the required features for the URL shortening service. While it did include functionality for URL shortening, redirection, and user accounts, it did not implement custom short links, analytics, an admin dashboard, or URL expiration. \n\nTo address this, I need to add functionality for the missing features. This would involve creating new routes and methods for viewing analytics, managing user accounts and URLs as an admin, and setting an expiration date for URLs. I would also need to add a way for users to choose custom short links. \n\nFinally, I need to create additional tests to ensure that these new features work as expected. This would involve testing the new routes and methods, as well as any new logic added to existing methods. \n\nPlan:\n1. Update the requirements.txt file to include all necessary dependencies.\n2. Add functionality for custom short links, analytics, an admin dashboard, and URL expiration to the code.\n3. Create additional tests for the new features.\n4. Run the tests to ensure that all features work as expected.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
