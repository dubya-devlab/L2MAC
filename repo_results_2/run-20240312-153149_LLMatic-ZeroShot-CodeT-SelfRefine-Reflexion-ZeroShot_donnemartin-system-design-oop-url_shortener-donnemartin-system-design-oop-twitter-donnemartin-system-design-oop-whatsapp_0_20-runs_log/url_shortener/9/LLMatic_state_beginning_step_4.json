Start by setting up the project structure and necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to manage the project dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and any other necessary libraries. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `Shortener` class in a file named `shortener.py`. This class should have a method `shorten_url` that takes a URL as input and returns a shortened version of the URL. The shortened URL should be unique for each input URL. Also, implement a method `validate_url` that checks if a URL is active and legitimate. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that they work as expected. The tests should check that the `shorten_url` method returns a unique shortened URL for each input and that the `validate_url` method correctly identifies active and legitimate URLs.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. In the Flask application, add a route that matches the pattern of the shortened URLs. When this route is accessed, the application should redirect to the original URL associated with the shortened URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that accessing a shortened URL correctly redirects to the original URL.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. Create an `Analytics` class in a file named `analytics.py`. This class should have methods to track and retrieve statistics about shortened URLs, such as the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that they work as expected. The tests should check that the analytics methods correctly track and retrieve the desired statistics.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `User` class in a file named `user.py`. This class should have methods to create an account, view all shortened URLs associated with an account, edit or delete a shortened URL, and view analytics for all shortened URLs. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that they work as expected. The tests should check that the user methods correctly manage user accounts and their associated URLs and analytics.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `Admin` class in a file named `admin.py`. This class should inherit from the `User` class and have additional methods to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that they work as expected. The tests should check that the admin methods correctly manage the system and its users and URLs.", "7. Implement the URL expiration feature. Add a method `set_expiration` to the `Shortener` class that allows users to set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. After the expiration date/time, the shortened URL should no longer redirect to the original URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that it works as expected. The tests should check that a shortened URL expires correctly and no longer redirects after its expiration date/time.", "8. Integrate all the features in the Flask application. The application should provide routes for users to input a URL to be shortened, choose a custom short link, view statistics about their shortened URLs, create an account, view all their shortened URLs, edit or delete their shortened URLs, and set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. Administrators should also be able to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application works as a whole. The tests should check that all routes and features function correctly together.", "9. Perform a final review of the code and tests. Ensure that the code follows best practices for Python and Flask, and that all tests pass. If any issues are found, fix them and rerun the tests. Also, ensure that the application meets all the functional requirements specified in the task.", "10. After all features have been implemented and all tests pass, the task is complete. The final step is to run the Flask application and ensure that it works as expected in a live environment. This can be done by running the `app.py` file and accessing the application in a web browser. Although you cannot use a human to test, you can simulate user interactions by making HTTP requests to the application and checking the responses."], "step": "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `User` class in a file named `user.py`. This class should have methods to create an account, view all shortened URLs associated with an account, edit or delete a shortened URL, and view analytics for all shortened URLs. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
