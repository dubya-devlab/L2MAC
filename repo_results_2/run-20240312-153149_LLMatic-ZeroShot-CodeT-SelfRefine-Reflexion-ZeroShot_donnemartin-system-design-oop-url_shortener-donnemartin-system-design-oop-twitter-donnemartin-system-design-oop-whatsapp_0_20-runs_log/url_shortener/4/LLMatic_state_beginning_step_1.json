Create a Flask application with the necessary routes for the URL shortening service. The routes should include '/shorten' for shortening URLs, '/' for redirecting shortened URLs to their original URLs, '/analytics' for viewing URL analytics, '/account' for user account related operations, and '/admin' for admin dashboard. Also, create a 'mock_db.py' file to simulate a database using an in-memory dictionary. This file should include functions for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting data. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database functions work as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. In the '/shorten' route, accept a POST request with the original URL and an optional custom short link. Validate the URL to ensure it's active and legitimate. If a custom short link is provided, check its availability. If it's not available, return an error message. If it's available or if no custom short link is provided, generate a unique shortened URL. Store the original URL and the shortened URL in the mock database. Return the shortened URL in the response. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature works as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In the '/' route, accept a GET request with the shortened URL. Retrieve the original URL from the mock database using the shortened URL. If the original URL is found, redirect to it. If it's not found, return a 404 error. Write tests to ensure that the redirection feature works as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the basic analytics feature. In the '/analytics' route, accept a GET request with the shortened URL. Retrieve the analytics data for the shortened URL from the mock database. The analytics data should include the number of clicks and the date/time of each click. Return the analytics data in the response. Write tests to ensure that the basic analytics feature works as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the user account creation feature. In the '/account' route, accept a POST request with the user's information. Store the user's information in the mock database. Return a success message in the response. Write tests to ensure that the user account creation feature works as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the feature for account holders to view, edit, and delete their shortened URLs. In the '/account' route, accept a GET request to retrieve all the shortened URLs for the logged-in user. Accept a PUT request to update a specific shortened URL for the logged-in user. Accept a DELETE request to delete a specific shortened URL for the logged-in user. Write tests to ensure that these features work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the feature for account holders to view analytics for all their shortened URLs. In the '/analytics' route, accept a GET request with the user's ID. Retrieve the analytics data for all the shortened URLs for the user from the mock database. Return the analytics data in the response. Write tests to ensure that this feature works as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the admin dashboard features. In the '/admin' route, accept a GET request to retrieve all shortened URLs. Accept a DELETE request to delete a specific URL or user account. Write tests to ensure that these features work as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the URL expiration feature. In the '/shorten' route, accept an optional expiration date/time for the shortened URL in the POST request. Store the expiration date/time in the mock database. In the '/' route, check the expiration date/time before redirecting to the original URL. If the shortened URL has expired, return a 404 error.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
