Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask for the web framework, pytest for testing, and requests for making HTTP requests to validate URLs. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain a `URLShortener` class. This class will have methods for validating URLs, generating short URLs, and storing the mapping between the original and short URLs in an in-memory dictionary. The validation of URLs will involve making a GET request to the URL and checking the response status. The generation of short URLs will involve creating a unique random string. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that URLs can be shortened correctly and that invalid URLs are rejected.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that matches the pattern of the short URLs. When this route is accessed, the application should look up the original URL from the in-memory dictionary and redirect to it. If the short URL does not exist in the dictionary, the application should return a 404 error. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that accessing short URLs correctly redirects to the original URLs or returns a 404 error when appropriate.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Modify the `URLShortener` class to keep track of the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker for each short URL. The geographical location can be determined from the IP address of the request. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the analytics data is correctly recorded and can be retrieved.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user.py` file that will contain a `User` class. This class will have methods for creating accounts, viewing all shortened URLs of a user, editing or deleting shortened URLs, and viewing analytics for all shortened URLs. The `User` class will interact with the `URLShortener` class to perform these operations. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that user accounts can be created and managed correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `admin.py` file that will contain an `Admin` class. This class will have methods for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. The `Admin` class will interact with the `User` and `URLShortener` classes to perform these operations. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard works correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the expiration feature. Modify the `URLShortener` class to allow setting an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. When a short URL is accessed, the application should check if the URL has expired and return a 404 error if it has. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the expiration of URLs works correctly.", "Step 8: Integrate all the features in the Flask application. Add routes in the `app.py` file for all the operations that can be performed by users and admins. These routes should call the appropriate methods of the `User`, `Admin`, and `URLShortener` classes. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application works as a whole and all the routes return the expected results.", "Step 9: Perform a final review of the code and tests. Check that all the requirements have been implemented, that the code follows best practices, and that all tests pass. If any issues are found, fix them and update the tests as necessary.", "Step 10: Document the application. Write comments in the code explaining the purpose of each class, method, and route. Also, create a `README.md` file explaining how to run the application and the tests, and how to use the application's features. After documenting the application, run the tests one last time to ensure that everything still works correctly."], "step": "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
