Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask application with the necessary files and directories. The main files will include `app.py` (the main application file), `models.py` (for database models), `views.py` (for handling routes and views), `services.py` (for business logic), and `utils.py` (for utility functions). Also, create a `tests` directory for all test files. Each feature will have its own test file, named with the prefix 'test_'. For example, the tests for URL shortening will be in `test_url_shortening.py`. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. In `models.py`, define a `URL` dataclass with fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who created it, and the creation and expiration dates. In `services.py`, write a function to generate a unique shortened URL. This function should take a URL and an optional custom short link as input, validate the URL, generate a unique short link if none was provided, and return the shortened URL. In `views.py`, create a route for users to submit URLs to be shortened. This route should call the URL shortening function and return the shortened URL. Write tests for the URL shortening function and the URL submission route, and run these tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature works correctly.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. In `views.py`, create a route for the shortened URLs. This route should take a short link as input, look up the corresponding URL in the database, and redirect to that URL. Write tests for the redirection route, and run these tests to ensure that the redirection feature works correctly.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. In `models.py`, define a `Click` dataclass with fields for the URL, the date/time of the click, and the geographical location of the clicker. In `services.py`, write a function to record a click. This function should take a URL as input, get the current date/time and geographical location, create a new Click, and save it to the database. In `views.py`, create a route for users to view statistics about their shortened URLs. This route should call the click recording function and return the statistics. Write tests for the click recording function and the statistics route, and run these tests to ensure that the analytics feature works correctly.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. In `models.py`, define a `User` dataclass with fields for the username, password, and a list of URLs. In `services.py`, write functions to create, view, edit, and delete users. In `views.py`, create routes for users to create accounts, view their URLs, and edit or delete their URLs. These routes should call the corresponding user functions. Write tests for the user functions and routes, and run these tests to ensure that the user accounts feature works correctly.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. In `services.py`, write functions for administrators to view all URLs and users, and delete any URL or user. In `views.py`, create routes for administrators to access the dashboard and perform these actions. These routes should call the corresponding admin functions. Write tests for the admin functions and routes, and run these tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature works correctly.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. In `services.py`, write a function to check if a URL has expired. This function should take a URL as input, compare the current date/time with the expiration date, and return a boolean indicating whether the URL has expired. In `views.py`, modify the URL submission and redirection routes to call the expiration check function and handle expired URLs appropriately. Write tests for the expiration check function and the modified routes, and run these tests to ensure that the expiration feature works correctly.", "8. After implementing all features, perform a comprehensive test of the entire application. This should include submitting a URL to be shortened, accessing the shortened URL, viewing statistics, creating a user account, viewing and editing URLs as a user, accessing the admin dashboard, and handling URL expiration. Run these tests to ensure that all features work together correctly.", "9. Once all tests pass, finalize the application. This includes cleaning up the code, adding comments, and ensuring that the code follows best practices. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file with all the necessary Python packages.", "10. Finally, package the application for deployment. This includes creating a setup script, packaging the application into a distributable format, and writing installation instructions. After packaging the application, write a test to ensure that the application can be installed and run correctly from the package."], "step": "3. Implement the redirection feature. In `views.py`, create a route for the shortened URLs. This route should take a short link as input, look up the corresponding URL in the database, and redirect to that URL.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
