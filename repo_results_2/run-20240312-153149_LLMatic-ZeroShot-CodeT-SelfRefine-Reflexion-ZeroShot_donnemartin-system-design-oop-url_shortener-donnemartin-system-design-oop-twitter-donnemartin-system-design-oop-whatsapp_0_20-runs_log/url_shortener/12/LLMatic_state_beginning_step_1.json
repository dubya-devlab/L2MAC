Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Flask application and set up the basic structure with the necessary files and folders. The main files will include `app.py` for the application entry point, `models.py` for the data models, `views.py` for the routes and views, and `utils.py` for utility functions. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary dependencies. Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the User model in `models.py`. This model will represent the users of the system and will have fields for the user's ID, username, and password. Implement the necessary methods for creating a new user, authenticating a user, and getting a user's details. Write tests to ensure that the User model is working correctly.", "3. Implement the URL model in `models.py`. This model will represent the URLs that users submit to be shortened. It will have fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who submitted it, the creation date, and the expiration date. Implement the necessary methods for creating a new URL, getting a URL's details, and deleting a URL. Write tests to ensure that the URL model is working correctly.", "4. Implement the utility functions in `utils.py`. These functions will include a function for validating URLs, a function for generating unique shortened URLs, and a function for checking the availability of custom short links. Write tests to ensure that these utility functions are working correctly.", "5. Implement the views and routes in `views.py`. These will include routes for creating a new user, authenticating a user, submitting a new URL to be shortened, accessing a shortened URL, viewing a user's URLs, and viewing a URL's analytics. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and returning the expected responses.", "6. Implement the analytics functionality. This will involve tracking each time a shortened URL is accessed, including the date/time of the access and the geographical location of the clicker. This data will be stored in a new Analytics model in `models.py`. Write tests to ensure that the analytics tracking is working correctly.", "7. Implement the user account functionality. This will involve creating routes for users to view, edit, and delete their URLs, as well as to view the analytics for their URLs. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and returning the expected responses.", "8. Implement the admin dashboard functionality. This will involve creating routes for administrators to view all URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and returning the expected responses.", "9. Implement the URL expiration functionality. This will involve adding a field to the URL model for the expiration date/time, and checking this field each time a shortened URL is accessed. If the current date/time is later than the expiration date/time, the URL will be deleted and the user will be redirected to an error page. Write tests to ensure that the URL expiration functionality is working correctly.", "10.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
