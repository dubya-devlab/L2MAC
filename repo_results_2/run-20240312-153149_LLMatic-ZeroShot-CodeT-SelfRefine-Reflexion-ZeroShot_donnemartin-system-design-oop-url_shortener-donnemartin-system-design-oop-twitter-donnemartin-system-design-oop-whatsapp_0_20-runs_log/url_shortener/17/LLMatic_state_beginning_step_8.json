Start by setting up the project structure and necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to manage the project dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and requests (for URL validation). After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `Shortener` class in a file named `shortener.py`. This class should have a method `shorten_url` that takes a URL as input and returns a shortened version of the URL. The shortened URL can be generated by hashing the input URL and taking a substring of the hash. Also, create a `URL` dataclass in a file named `models.py` to represent a URL object. The `URL` class should have fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, and the user who created it. After implementing the URL shortening feature, write tests to ensure that the `shorten_url` method works correctly and returns unique shortened URLs for different input URLs.", "3. Implement the URL validation feature. Add a method `validate_url` to the `Shortener` class that takes a URL as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the URL is active and legitimate. This can be done by sending a GET request to the URL and checking the response status code. After implementing the URL validation feature, write tests to ensure that the `validate_url` method correctly identifies active and legitimate URLs.", "4. Implement the custom short link feature. Modify the `shorten_url` method of the `Shortener` class to accept an optional parameter for a custom short link. If a custom short link is provided, the method should use it instead of generating a new one. After implementing the custom short link feature, write tests to ensure that the `shorten_url` method correctly uses the custom short link when provided.", "5. Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that matches the pattern of the shortened URLs. When this route is accessed, it should redirect to the original URL associated with the shortened URL. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that accessing a shortened URL correctly redirects to the original URL.", "6. Implement the analytics feature. Add a `clicks` field to the `URL` class to keep track of the number of times the shortened URL has been accessed. Also, add a `click_details` field to store the date/time and geographical location of each click. The geographical location can be determined using the IP address of the request. After implementing the analytics feature, write tests to ensure that the click count and click details are correctly updated when a shortened URL is accessed.", "7. Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `User` class in the `models.py` file to represent a user. The `User` class should have fields for the username, password, and a list of URLs created by the user. Also, add routes in the `app.py` file for user registration and login. After implementing the user accounts feature, write tests to ensure that users can register, login, and view their URLs.", "8. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Add an `isAdmin` field to the `User` class to indicate whether a user is an administrator. Also, add routes in the `app.py` file for administrators to view all URLs and user accounts, and to delete any URL or user account. After implementing the admin dashboard feature, write tests to ensure that administrators can perform their tasks correctly.", "9. Implement the URL expiration feature. Add an `expiration_date` field to the `URL` class to store the expiration date/time of the URL. Modify the redirection route in the `app.py` file to check the expiration date/time before redirecting. If the URL has expired, it should return an error message instead of redirecting. After implementing the URL expiration feature, write tests to ensure that expired URLs are handled correctly.", "10. Finally, review the entire application and make any necessary improvements. Ensure that all features are working correctly and that the code is clean and well-organized. Also, run all tests to ensure that they all pass. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues until all tests pass."], "step": "9. Implement the URL expiration feature.

Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
