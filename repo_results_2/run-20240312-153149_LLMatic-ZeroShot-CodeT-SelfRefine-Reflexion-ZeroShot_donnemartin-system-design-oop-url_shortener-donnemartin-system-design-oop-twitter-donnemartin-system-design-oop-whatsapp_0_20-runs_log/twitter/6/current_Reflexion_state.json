The application does not check if the user exists before creating a post, and the test expects a 400 status code when creating a post with a non-existent user, which is not implemented in the application.\n\nTo mitigate this, the new plan would be to refactor the post creation route in the Flask application to check if the user exists before creating a post. If the user does not exist, the application should return a 400 status code with an appropriate error message. The test case for post creation should then be updated to reflect this change. This way, we can accurately test the application's behavior.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n
