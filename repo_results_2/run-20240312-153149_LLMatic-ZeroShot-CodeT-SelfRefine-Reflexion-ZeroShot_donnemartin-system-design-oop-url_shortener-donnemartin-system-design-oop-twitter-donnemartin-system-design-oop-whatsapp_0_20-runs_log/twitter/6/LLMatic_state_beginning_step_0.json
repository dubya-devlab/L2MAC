This class should have attributes for `email`, `username`, `password`, and `is_private` (for profile privacy). Implement methods for registering a new user (`register`), authenticating a user (`authenticate`), and resetting a user's password (`reset_password`). Use a dictionary to mock a database for storing user data. For password security, use a hashing algorithm to store passwords. For authentication, use a JWT or a similar protocol. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_user.py` to test the `User` class methods. Use the `pytest` library for writing tests. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Add methods to the `User` class for editing profile information (`edit_profile`), and toggling profile privacy (`toggle_privacy`). The `edit_profile` method should allow users to edit their `profile_picture`, `bio`, `website_link`, and `location`. The `toggle_privacy` method should switch the `is_private` attribute between `True` and `False`. After implementing these methods, add tests for them in the `test_user.py` file. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "3. **Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Create a `Post` class in a file named `post.py`. This class should have attributes for `user`, `content`, `image`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for creating a new post (`create`), and deleting a post (`delete`). Use a dictionary to mock a database for storing post data. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_post.py` to test the `Post` class methods. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Add methods to the `Post` class for liking a post (`like`), retweeting a post (`retweet`), and replying to a post (`reply`). The `like` method should increment a `likes` counter, the `retweet` method should increment a `retweets` counter, and the `reply` method should add a reply to a `replies` list. After implementing these methods, add tests for them in the `test_post.py` file. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "5. **Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement a `search` function in a file named `search.py`. This function should take a keyword as an argument and return a list of posts and users that match the keyword. Add a `filter` function that takes a hashtag, user mention, or trending topic as an argument and returns a list of relevant posts. After implementing these functions, write a test file named `test_search.py` to test them. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Add methods to the `User` class for following a user (`follow`), unfollowing a user (`unfollow`), and viewing a timeline (`view_timeline`). The `follow` method should add a user to a `following` list, the `unfollow` method should remove a user from the `following` list, and the `view_timeline` method should return a list of posts from followed users. After implementing these methods, add tests for them in the `test_user.py` file. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Create a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender`, `receiver`, `content`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for sending a message (`send`), and blocking a user (`block`). Use a dictionary to mock a database for storing message data. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_message.py` to test the `Message` class methods. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Add methods to the `User` class for receiving notifications (`receive_notification`). This method should add a notification to a `notifications` list. Notifications should be generated when a user's post is liked, retweeted, replied to, or when the user is mentioned in a post. After implementing this method, add tests for it in the `test_user.py` file. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `trending_topics` function in a file named `trending.py`. This function should identify and return a list of trending hashtags or topics based on the volume and velocity of mentions. After implementing this function, write a test file named `test_trending.py` to test it. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Add a method to the `User` class for getting user recommendations (`get_recommendations`). This method should return a list of users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. After implementing this method, add tests for it in the `test_user.py` file. Run the tests to ensure they all pass."], "step": "1. **User Management - Registration & Authentication:** Start by creating a `User` class in a file named `user.py`.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
