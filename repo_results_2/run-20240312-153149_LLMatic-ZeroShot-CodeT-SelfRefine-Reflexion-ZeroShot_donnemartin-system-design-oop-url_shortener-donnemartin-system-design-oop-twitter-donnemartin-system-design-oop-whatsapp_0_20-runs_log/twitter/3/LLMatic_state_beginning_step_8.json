Use JWT or a similar protocol for secure authentication. For the password, store only a hashed version of it for security reasons. Use an in-memory dictionary to mock a database for storing user data. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_user.py` to test the functionality of the `User` class. Use pytest for writing the tests. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Extend the `User` class to include additional attributes for `profile_picture`, `bio`, `website_link`, and `location`.

After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_post.py` to test the functionality of the `Post` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Extend the `Post` class to include methods for liking a post (`like_post`), retweeting a post (`retweet_post`), and replying to a post (`reply_to_post`). Implement a nested comment structure for post replies. After implementing these methods, extend the tests in `test_post.py` to test the new functionality. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "5. **Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement a `Search` class in a file named `search.py`. This class should have methods for searching for specific posts or users using keywords (`search_posts`, `search_users`), and filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics (`filter_posts`). After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_search.py` to test the functionality of the `Search` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Extend the `User` class to include methods for following and unfollowing other users (`follow_user`, `unfollow_user`). Implement a `Timeline` class in a file named `timeline.py` that displays posts from followed users. The `Timeline` class should have a method for getting the timeline posts (`get_timeline_posts`). After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_timeline.py` to test the functionality of the `Timeline` class. Extend the tests in `test_user.py` to test the new functionality in the `User` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Implement a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender`, `receiver`, `content`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for sending a message (`send_message`) and blocking/unblocking users from messaging (`block_user`, `unblock_user`). Use an in-memory dictionary to mock a database for storing message data. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_message.py` to test the functionality of the `Message` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Extend the `User` class to include a method for notifying users of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions (`notify`). After implementing this method, extend the tests in `test_user.py` to test the new functionality. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `Trending` class in a file named `trending.py`. This class should have methods for identifying and displaying trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions (`get_trending_topics`), and sorting trending topics based on location or globally (`sort_trending_topics`). After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_trending.py` to test the functionality of the `Trending` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Extend the `User` class to include a method for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers (`recommend_users`).

You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output.
