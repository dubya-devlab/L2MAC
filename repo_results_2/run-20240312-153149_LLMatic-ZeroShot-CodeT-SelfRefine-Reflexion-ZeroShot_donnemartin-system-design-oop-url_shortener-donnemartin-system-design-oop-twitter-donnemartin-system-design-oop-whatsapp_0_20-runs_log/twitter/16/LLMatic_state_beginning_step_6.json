["1. **Setup the project structure:** Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. The project will need a main application file (app.py), a configuration file (config.py), a models file (models.py) to define the data models, a routes file (routes.py) to define the application routes, and a utilities file (utils.py) to hold utility functions. Also, create a tests directory to hold all the test files. Each feature will have its own test file named with the prefix 'test_'. For example, the tests for the user management feature will be in a file named 'test_user_management.py'. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. **Implement User Management - Registration & Authentication:** In the models.py file, define a User class with fields for email, username, and password. Implement the registration feature in the routes.py file. The registration route should accept a POST request with the user's email, username, and password, create a new User instance, and store it in the in-memory database. Implement the authentication feature. The authentication route should accept a POST request with the user's email and password, verify the credentials against the stored User instances, and return a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests for the registration and authentication features. The tests should check that a user can register, that a user cannot register with an email or username that is already in use, that a user can authenticate with valid credentials, and that a user cannot authenticate with invalid credentials.", "3. **Implement User Management - Profile Management:** Add fields for profile picture, bio, website link, and location to the User class. Implement the profile management feature. The profile management route should accept a GET request to retrieve the user's profile information, and a PUT request to update the user's profile information. The PUT request should require the JWT token for authentication. Write tests for the profile management feature. The tests should check that a user can retrieve and update their profile information, and that a user cannot update their profile information without a valid JWT token.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Define a Post class in the models.py file. The Post class should have fields for the post text, images, and the user who created the post. Implement the post creation feature. The post creation route should accept a POST request with the post text and images, create a new Post instance, and store it in the in-memory database. The POST request should require the JWT token for authentication. Write tests for the post creation feature. The tests should check that a user can create a post, and that a user cannot create a post without a valid JWT token.", "5. **Implement Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Add fields for likes, retweets, and replies to the Post class. Implement the post interaction features. The like, retweet, and reply routes should accept POST requests with the post ID, update the corresponding field in the Post instance, and require the JWT token for authentication. Write tests for the post interaction features. The tests should check that a user can like, retweet, and reply to a post, and that a user cannot interact with a post without a valid JWT token.", "6. **Implement Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. The search route should accept a GET request with a keyword, and return all Post instances that contain the keyword in the post text. The filter route should accept a GET request with a hashtag, user mention, or trending topic, and return all Post instances that contain the matching element. Write tests for the content filtering and search feature. The tests should check that a user can search for posts and users, and filter posts based on hashtags, user mentions, and trending topics.", "7. **Implement Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Add a followers field to the User class. Implement the follow and unfollow features. The follow and unfollow routes should accept POST requests with the target user's username, update the followers field in the User instances, and require the JWT token for authentication. Write tests for the follow and unfollow features. The tests should check that a user can follow and unfollow other users, and that a user cannot follow or unfollow without a valid JWT token.", "8. **Implement Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Define a Message class in the models.py file. The Message class should have fields for the sender, recipient, and message text. Implement the direct messaging feature. The direct messaging route should accept a POST request with the recipient's username and the message text, create a new Message instance, and store it in the in-memory database. The POST request should require the JWT token for authentication. Write tests for the direct messaging feature. The tests should check that a user can send a direct message, and that a user cannot send a direct message without a valid JWT token.", "9. **Implement Social Interaction - Notifications:** Add a notifications field to the User class. Implement the notifications feature. The notifications route should accept a GET request, return the user's notifications, and require the JWT token for authentication. Write tests for the notifications feature. The tests should check that a user can retrieve their notifications, and that a user cannot retrieve their notifications without a valid JWT token.", "10. **Implement Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics & User Recommendations:** Implement the trending topics feature. The trending topics route should accept a GET request, calculate the trending topics based on the volume and velocity of mentions in the Post instances, and return the trending topics. Implement the user recommendations feature. The user recommendations route should accept a GET request, calculate the recommended users based on interests, activity, and mutual followers, and return the recommended users. Write tests for the trending topics and user recommendations features. The tests should check that a user can retrieve the trending topics and recommended users."], "step": "7. **Implement Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Add a followers field to the User class. Implement the follow and unfollow features. The follow and unfollow routes should accept POST requests with the target user's username, update the followers field in the User instances, and require the JWT token for authentication. Write tests for the follow and unfollow features. The tests should check that a user can follow and unfollow other users, and that a user cannot follow or unfollow without a valid JWT token.", "meta_messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\nObjective: Write code for a large system design task.\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional.
