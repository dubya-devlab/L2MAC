In Python, mutable default arguments can lead to unexpected behavior because they are created only once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. In this case, the 'followers' field in the User class and the 'likes' field in the Post class were defined as empty dictionaries as default values, which is not allowed in dataclasses.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, the new plan would be to use the 'default_factory' option provided by the dataclasses module. This option allows us to specify a function that returns a new instance of the desired default value, which will be called each time a new instance of the class is created. This way, each instance will have its own separate copy of the default value, avoiding the issue with mutable default arguments. \n\nThe revised code would look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\n\n@dataclass\nclass User:\n    name: str\n    email: str\n    password: str\n    followers: Dict[str, 'User'] = field(default_factory=dict)\n\n@dataclass\nclass Post:\n    user: User\n    content: str\n    likes: Dict[str, User] = field(default_factory=dict)\n```\n\nThis change should be applied to all the classes that use mutable default arguments in their fields. After updating the code, the tests should be run again to verify that the issue has been resolved.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n

No data saved to disk will persis between steps or write operations.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n                                       \nPython toolbelt preferences:\n- pytest\n- dataclasses\n- flask\n\nObjective:```\n**Online Microblogging Service (OMS) - Description & Requirements**\n\n*Description:*  \nA web-based platform where registered users can post short text-based messages, view messages from others, follow/unfollow other users, and interact with posts. The platform provides features for both individual users and administrative management.\n\n**Functional Requirements to implement**:\n\n1. **User Management:**\n    1. **Registration & Authentication:**  \n        - [ ] Allow users to register using email, username, and password.\n        - [ ] Option to reset forgotten passwords.\n        - [ ] Secure authentication using JWT or similar protocols.\n    2. **Profile Management:**  \n        - [ ] Users can edit their profile information: profile picture, bio, website link, and location.\n        - [ ] Option to make profile private or public.\n\n2. **Posting & Content Management:**\n    1. **Creating Posts (Tweets):**  \n        - [ ] Allow users to create text-based posts with a limit of 280 characters.\n        - [ ] Option to include images in posts.\n        - [ ] Users can delete their own posts.\n    2. **Interacting with Posts:**  \n        - [ ] Users can like, retweet, and reply to posts.\n        - [ ] Nested comment structure for post replies.\n    3. **Content Filtering & Search:**  \n        - [ ] Users can search for specific posts or users using keywords.\n        - [ ] Filter option based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics.\n\n3. **Social Interaction:**\n    1. **Following & Followers:**  \n        - [ ] Users can follow/unfollow other users.\n        - [ ] A timeline view displays posts from followed users.\n        - [ ] Users receive notifications for new followers.\n    2. **Direct Messaging:**  \n        - [ ] Private conversation threads between users.\n        - [ ] Option to block/unblock users from messaging.\n    3. **Notifications:**  \n        - [ ] Users are notified of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions.\n\n4. **Trending & Discovery:**\n    1. **Trending Topics:**  \n        - [ ] System identifies and displays trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions.\n        - [ ] Trending topics can be sorted based on location or globally.\n    2. **User Recommendations:**  \n        - [ ] Recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers.\n```\n\nThe failure in the previous code generation was due to the incorrect use of mutable default arguments in the dataclasses. In Python, mutable default arguments can lead to unexpected behavior because they are created only once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. In this case, the 'followers' field in the User class and the 'likes' field in the Post class were defined as empty dictionaries as default values, which is not allowed in dataclasses.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, the new plan would be to use the 'default_factory' option provided by the dataclasses module. This option allows us to specify a function that returns a new instance of the desired default value, which will be called each time a new instance of the class is created. This way, each instance will have its own separate copy of the default value, avoiding the issue with mutable default arguments. \n\nThe revised code would look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\n\n@dataclass\nclass User:\n    name: str\n    email: str\n    password: str\n    followers: Dict[str, 'User'] = field(default_factory=dict)\n\n@dataclass\nclass Post:\n    user: User\n    content: str\n    likes: Dict[str, User] = field(default_factory=dict)\n```\n\nThis change should be applied to all the classes that use mutable default arguments in their fields. After updating the code, the tests should be run again to verify that the issue has been resolved.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n
