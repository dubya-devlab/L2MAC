project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly setup and that all dependencies are correctly installed.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication functionality. This includes creating a User dataclass to represent a user, and implementing the registration and login routes in the Flask application. The registration route should accept a POST request with the user's email, username, and password, create a new User object, and store it in an in-memory dictionary to mock a database. The login route should accept a POST request with the user's email and password, verify the credentials against the stored User objects, and return a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests to ensure that the registration and login routes work as expected, and that the JWT token is correctly generated and returned.", "3. **User Profile Management:** Implement the user profile management functionality. This includes creating a Profile dataclass to represent a user's profile, and implementing the edit profile route in the Flask application. The edit profile route should accept a POST request with the user's JWT token and the new profile information (profile picture, bio, website link, and location), update the corresponding User object's Profile, and return a success message.

This includes creating a Post dataclass to represent a post, and implementing the create post route in the Flask application. The create post route should accept a POST request with the user's JWT token and the post content (text and optional image), create a new Post object, and store it in an in-memory dictionary to mock a database. Write tests to ensure that the create post route works as expected, and that the Post object is correctly created and stored.", "5. **Interacting with Posts:** Implement the functionality for interacting with posts. This includes implementing the like, retweet, and reply routes in the Flask application. Each of these routes should accept a POST request with the user's JWT token and the post ID, update the corresponding Post object, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the like, retweet, and reply routes work as expected, and that the Post object is correctly updated.", "6. **Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the functionality for content filtering and search. This includes implementing the search route in the Flask application. The search route should accept a GET request with the search query, filter the stored Post objects based on the query, and return the matching posts. Write tests to ensure that the search route works as expected, and that the correct posts are returned.", "7. **Following & Followers:** Implement the functionality for following and unfollowing users. This includes implementing the follow and unfollow routes in the Flask application. Each of these routes should accept a POST request with the user's JWT token and the other user's ID, update the corresponding User object's followers or following list, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the follow and unfollow routes work as expected, and that the User object's followers or following list is correctly updated.", "8. **Direct Messaging:** Implement the functionality for direct messaging between users. This includes creating a Message dataclass to represent a message, and implementing the send message route in the Flask application. The send message route should accept a POST request with the user's JWT token, the recipient's ID, and the message content, create a new Message object, and store it in an in-memory dictionary to mock a database. Write tests to ensure that the send message route works as expected, and that the Message object is correctly created and stored.", "9. **Notifications:** Implement the functionality for notifications. This includes creating a Notification dataclass to represent a notification, and implementing the create notification route in the Flask application. The create notification route should accept a POST request with the user's JWT token and the notification content, create a new Notification object, and store it in an in-memory dictionary to mock a database. Write tests to ensure that the create notification route works as expected, and that the Notification object is correctly created and stored.", "10. **Trending & Discovery:** Implement the functionality for identifying and displaying trending topics. This includes implementing the get trending topics route in the Flask application. The get trending topics route should accept a GET request, calculate the trending topics based on the stored Post objects, and return the trending topics. Write tests to ensure that the get trending topics route works as expected, and that the correct trending topics are returned."], "step": "5. **Interacting with Posts:** Implement the functionality for interacting with posts.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
