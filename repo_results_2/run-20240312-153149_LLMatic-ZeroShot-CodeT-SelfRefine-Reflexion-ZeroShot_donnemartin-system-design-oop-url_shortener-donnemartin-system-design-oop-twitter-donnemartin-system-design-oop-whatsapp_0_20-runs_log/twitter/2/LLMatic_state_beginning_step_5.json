This class should have attributes for `email`, `username`, `password`, and `is_private` (for profile privacy). Implement methods for registering a new user (`register`), authenticating a user (`authenticate`), and resetting a user's password (`reset_password`). Use a dictionary to mock a database for storing user data. The `register` method should check if a user with the given email or username already exists before adding a new user. The `authenticate` method should verify the user's credentials. The `reset_password` method should update the user's password. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_user.py` to verify that the `User` class methods work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Add methods to the `User` class for editing profile information (`edit_profile`), and toggling profile privacy (`toggle_privacy`). The `edit_profile` method should update the user's profile picture, bio, website link, and location. The `toggle_privacy` method should switch the `is_private` attribute between `True` and `False`. After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for these new methods. Run these tests using pytest.", "3. **Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Create a `Post` class in a file named `post.py`. This class should have attributes for `user`, `text`, `image`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for creating a new post (`create`), and deleting a post (`delete`). The `create` method should create a new post with the given user, text, and optional image. The `delete` method should remove a post. Use a dictionary to mock a database for storing post data. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_post.py` to verify that the `Post` class methods work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Add methods to the `Post` class for liking a post (`like`), retweeting a post (`retweet`), and replying to a post (`reply`). The `like` method should increment a `likes` counter for the post. The `retweet` method should increment a `retweets` counter for the post and add the post to the user's posts. The `reply` method should add a reply to a `replies` list for the post. After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_post.py` to include tests for these new methods. Run these tests using pytest.", "5. **Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement a `search` function in a file named `search.py`. This function should take a keyword as input and return a list of posts and users that match the keyword. The function should search the text of posts and the username and bio of users. After implementing this function, write tests in a file named `test_search.py` to verify that the `search` function works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Add methods to the `User` class for following a user (`follow`), unfollowing a user (`unfollow`), and viewing a timeline (`view_timeline`). The `follow` method should add a user to the user's `following` list and add the user to the followed user's `followers` list. The `unfollow` method should remove a user from the user's `following` list and remove the user from the unfollowed user's `followers` list. The `view_timeline` method should return a list of posts from the user's `following` list. After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for these new methods. Run these tests using pytest.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Create a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender`, `receiver`, `text`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for sending a message (`send`) and blocking a user (`block`). The `send` method should create a new message with the given sender, receiver, and text. The `block` method should add a user to the sender's `blocked` list. Use a dictionary to mock a database for storing message data. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_message.py` to verify that the `Message` class methods work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Add methods to the `User` class for liking a post (`like`), retweeting a post (`retweet`), replying to a post (`reply`), and following a user (`follow`). These methods should now also add a notification to the relevant user's `notifications` list. The `notifications` list should be a list of strings describing the notification. After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for these new methods. Run these tests using pytest.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `trending` function in a file named `trending.py`. This function should return a list of the most frequently used hashtags in the text of all posts. The function should take an optional `location` parameter and return trending hashtags for that location if provided. After implementing this function, write tests in a file named `test_trending.py` to verify that the `trending` function works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Implement a `recommend` function in a file named `recommend.py`. This function should take a user as input and return a list of users that the user might be interested in following. The function should recommend users who have a high number of mutual followers with the user, users who post about similar topics as the user, and users who have a high level of activity. After implementing this function, write tests in a file named `test_recommend.py` to verify that the `recommend` function works as expected. Run these tests using pytest."], "step": "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Add methods to the `User` class for following a user (`follow`), unfollowing a user (`unfollow`), and viewing a timeline (`view_timeline`).

The `unfollow` method should remove a user from the user's `following` list and remove the user from the unfollowed user's `followers` list. The `view_timeline` method should return a list of posts from the user's `following` list. After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for these new methods.
