Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and the application runs without errors.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password, and a function to register new users. The function should validate the input data, hash the password for security, and store the user data in a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). Also, implement the user authentication feature. This involves creating a function to authenticate users based on their username and password, and generate a JWT token for authenticated users. Write tests to ensure that the user registration and authentication features work as expected.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves creating a Profile dataclass with fields for profile picture, bio, website link, and location, and functions to edit and view user profiles. The functions should validate the input data and update the user's profile in the mock database. Also, implement the feature to make profiles private or public. Write tests to ensure that the profile management features work as expected.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass with fields for post content, images, and user, and a function to create new posts. The function should validate the input data and store the post data in the mock database. Also, implement the feature to delete posts and interact with posts (like, retweet, and reply). This involves creating functions to update the post data in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content management features work as expected.", "5. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves creating a function to search for posts or users based on keywords, and filter posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. The function should return the relevant posts or users from the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search feature works as expected.", "6. **Implement Social Interaction:** Implement the social interaction features. This involves creating functions to follow/unfollow users, view posts from followed users, and receive notifications for new followers. Also, implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for message content and users, and functions to send and receive messages. The functions should update the user and message data in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the social interaction features work as expected.", "7. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for notification content and user, and functions to send and receive notifications. The functions should update the user and notification data in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the notifications feature works as expected.", "8. **Implement Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending and discovery features. This involves creating functions to identify and display trending hashtags or topics, and recommend users to follow. The functions should return the relevant data from the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery features work as expected.", "9. **Implement the Web Interface:** Implement the web interface using Flask and HTML templates. This involves creating routes for the different features (user registration, user authentication, profile management, posting, content filtering and search, social interaction, notifications, trending and discovery), and templates for the different pages (registration page, login page, profile page, post page, search page, notifications page, trending page). Write tests to ensure that the web interface works as expected.", "10. **Final Testing and Refactoring:** Perform a final round of testing to ensure that all features work together as expected. This involves running all the tests and manually testing the application. If any issues are found, refactor the code as necessary. Also, review the code to ensure that it follows best practices for coding and software design. Finally, write a test to ensure that the final application works as expected."], "step": "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
