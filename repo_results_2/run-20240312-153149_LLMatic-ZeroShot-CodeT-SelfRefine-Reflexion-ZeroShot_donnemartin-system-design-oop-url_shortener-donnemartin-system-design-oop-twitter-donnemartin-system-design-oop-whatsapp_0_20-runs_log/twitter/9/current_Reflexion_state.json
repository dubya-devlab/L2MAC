Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\nusers = {}\\nposts = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tname: str\\n\\temail: str\\n\\tpassword: str\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Post:\\n\\tuser: User\\n\\tcontent: str\\n\\n@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])\\ndef register():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = User(data['name'], data['email'], data['password'])\\n\\tusers[user.email] = user\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'User registered successfully'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\\ndef login():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users.get(data['email'])\\n\\tif user and user.password == data['password']:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Logged in successfully'}), 200\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401\\n\\n@app.route('/update_profile', methods=['PUT'])\\ndef update_profile():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users.get(data['email'])\\n\\tif user and user.password == data['password']:\\n\\t\\tuser.name = data['name']\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Profile updated successfully'}), 200\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401\\n\\n@app.route('/create_post', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_post():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users.get(data['email'])\\n\\tif user and user.password == data['password']:\\n\\t\\tpost = Post(user, data['content'])\\n\\t\\tposts[len(posts)] = post\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Post created successfully'}), 201\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nfrom app import User, Post\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\n\\ndef test_register(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/register', json={'name': 'Test User', 'email': 'test@example.com', 'password': 'test123'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'User registered successfully'}\\n\\tassert isinstance(app.users['test@example.com'], User)\\n\\n\\ndef test_login(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/login', json={'email': 'test@example.com', 'password': 'test123'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'Logged in successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_update_profile(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.put('/update_profile', json={'name': 'Updated User', 'email': 'test@example.com', 'password': 'test123'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'Profile updated successfully'}\\n\\tassert app.users['test@example.com'].name == 'Updated User'\\n\\n\\ndef test_create_post(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/create_post', json={'content': 'Test post', 'email': 'test@example.com', 'password': 'test123'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'Post created successfully'}\\n\\tassert isinstance(app.posts[0], Post)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "name": "write_files"}, "role": "assistant"}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"All tests passed.\"}"}]}
