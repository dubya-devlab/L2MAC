You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided.

Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The main dependencies will be Flask, Pytest, and PyJWT. Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication system. This includes creating a User class with attributes for email, username, and password, and methods for registering a new user and authenticating existing users. Use JWT for secure authentication. Write tests to ensure that user registration, authentication, and JWT generation are working correctly.", "3. **User Profile Management:** Implement the user profile management system. This includes adding additional attributes to the User class for profile picture, bio, website link, and location, and methods for editing these attributes. Also, implement a method for toggling the user's profile between private and public. Write tests to ensure that user profile management is working correctly.", "4. **Creating Posts (Tweets):** Implement the system for creating posts. This includes creating a Post class with attributes for the post text, images, and the user who created the post, and a method for creating a new post. Also, implement a method in the User class for deleting a user's own posts. Write tests to ensure that post creation and deletion are working correctly.", "5. **Interacting with Posts:** Implement the system for interacting with posts. This includes creating a Comment class with attributes for the comment text, the user who created the comment, and the post the comment is associated with. Also, add methods to the Post class for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts. Write tests to ensure that post interaction is working correctly.", "6. **Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the system for content filtering and search. This includes creating a Search class with methods for searching for specific posts or users using keywords, and filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. Write tests to ensure that content filtering and search are working correctly.", "7. **Following & Followers:** Implement the system for following and followers. This includes adding methods to the User class for following and unfollowing other users, and a method for displaying a timeline view of posts from followed users. Also, implement a method for notifying users of new followers. Write tests to ensure that the following and followers system is working correctly.", "8. **Direct Messaging:** Implement the system for direct messaging. This includes creating a Message class with attributes for the message text, the sender, and the recipient, and methods for sending and receiving messages. Also, add a method to the User class for blocking and unblocking other users from messaging. Write tests to ensure that direct messaging is working correctly.", "9. **Notifications:** Implement the system for notifications.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
