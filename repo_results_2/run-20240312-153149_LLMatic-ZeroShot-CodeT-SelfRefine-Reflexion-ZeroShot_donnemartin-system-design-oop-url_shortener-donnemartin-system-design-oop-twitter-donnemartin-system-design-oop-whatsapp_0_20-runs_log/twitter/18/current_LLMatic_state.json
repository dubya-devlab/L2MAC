Run the tests to ensure they pass..\n\n Note: Condition any new code files on the existing code files: ['user.py', 'test_user.py', 'post.py', 'test_post.py', 'search.py', 'test_search.py']. Fully implement these features in the code, no placeholders. You can now optionally view the existing files if you need to view them to complete the current task step. You have a limited context window so be selective about which files you view, only view the files you think you might need to view.\n\nSummary output of previous step: \"\"The `User` class now includes methods for following and unfollowing users, viewing a timeline of posts from followed users, and a notification system for new followers. Corresponding tests have been added to `test_user.py` and all tests have passed successfully.\"\"\n\nRespond now only with a function call of one of the following functions provided: `sub_task_step_complete`, `view_files`, `run_python_file`, `pytest_files`, `write_files`, `delete_files`, and if you want to output code only use the `write_files` function to output code.\n"}], "message_hash": "30dcbddc5f334847102e685f5db53ea3ade884ee0caae0b4c120461fc815c917"}
