The dependencies will include Flask for the web framework, Pytest for testing, and PyJWT for handling JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the User Management functionality. Create a new Python file named `user.py` to handle user-related operations. This file will contain a User class with methods for registration, authentication, and profile management. The User class will have attributes such as email, username, password, profile picture, bio, website link, and location. The password should be hashed for security purposes. Write tests to ensure that the User class methods work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the Posting & Content Management functionality. Create a new Python file named `post.py` to handle post-related operations. This file will contain a Post class with methods for creating, deleting, and interacting with posts. The Post class will have attributes such as text, images, likes, retweets, and replies. Write tests to ensure that the Post class methods work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the Social Interaction functionality. Add methods in the User class for following/unfollowing other users, receiving notifications, and blocking/unblocking users from messaging. Also, add methods in the Post class for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts. Write tests to ensure that these methods work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the Trending & Discovery functionality.

This file will contain a Trending class with methods for identifying and displaying trending hashtags or topics, and recommending users to follow. Write tests to ensure that the Trending class methods work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the JWT authentication. Add methods in the User class for generating and validating JWT. The JWT should be used to authenticate users and protect certain routes in the Flask application. Write tests to ensure that the JWT authentication works as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the Flask routes. In the `app.py` file, define the routes for user registration, user authentication, creating posts, deleting posts, interacting with posts, following/unfollowing users, receiving notifications, blocking/unblocking users, identifying and displaying trending topics, and recommending users. Write tests to ensure that the Flask routes work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the search functionality. Add a method in the Post class for searching for specific posts or users using keywords. Also, add a method in the Trending class for filtering based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. Write tests to ensure that the search functionality works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the direct messaging functionality. Create a new Python file named `message.py` to handle message-related operations. This file will contain a Message class with methods for sending and receiving messages. Write tests to ensure that the Message class methods work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, run all the tests to ensure that all the functionalities work as expected.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
