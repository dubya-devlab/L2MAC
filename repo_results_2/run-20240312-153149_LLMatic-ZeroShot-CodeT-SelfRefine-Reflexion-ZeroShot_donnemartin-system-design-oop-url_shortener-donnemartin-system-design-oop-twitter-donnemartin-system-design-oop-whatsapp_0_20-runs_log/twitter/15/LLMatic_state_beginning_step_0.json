Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for models (models/), a directory for routes (routes/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up and that all dependencies are correctly installed.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication functionality. In the models directory, create a User model with fields for email, username, and password. The password should be hashed before being stored in the database. In the routes directory, create routes for user registration and login. The registration route should take in an email, username, and password, create a new User instance, and store it in the database. The login route should take in a username and password, verify the credentials, and return a JWT token if the credentials are correct. Write tests to ensure that the registration and login functionality works as expected.", "3. **Password Reset:** Implement the password reset functionality. This involves creating a route that takes in an email, generates a password reset token, and sends an email to the user with the reset token. Another route should take in the reset token and the new password, verify the token, and update the user's password in the database. Write tests to ensure that the password reset functionality works as expected.", "4. **Profile Management:** Implement the profile management functionality. This involves adding additional fields to the User model for the profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Also, add a boolean field to indicate whether the profile is private or public. Create routes to update these fields. Write tests to ensure that the profile management functionality works as expected.", "5. **Creating Posts:** Implement the functionality for creating posts. Create a Post model with fields for the post content, the user who created the post, and the timestamp. The post content should be limited to 280 characters. Create a route to create a new post. Write tests to ensure that the post creation functionality works as expected.", "6. **Interacting with Posts:** Implement the functionality for interacting with posts. This involves creating models for likes, retweets, and replies. Each of these models should have a reference to the user who performed the action and the post on which the action was performed. Create routes to like, retweet, and reply to posts. Write tests to ensure that the post interaction functionality works as expected.", "7. **Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the functionality for content filtering and search. This involves creating a route that takes in a keyword and returns posts and users that match the keyword. Also, create a route that takes in a hashtag and returns posts that include the hashtag. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search functionality works as expected.", "8. **Following & Followers:** Implement the functionality for following and unfollowing users. This involves creating a Follow model with fields for the follower and the followee. Create routes to follow and unfollow users. Also, create a route to get the posts of the users that a given user follows. Write tests to ensure that the following and followers functionality works as expected.", "9. **Direct Messaging:** Implement the functionality for direct messaging. This involves creating a Message model with fields for the sender, the receiver, the message content, and the timestamp. Create routes to send a message and to get the messages between two users. Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging functionality works as expected.", "10. **Trending & Discovery:** Implement the functionality for identifying and displaying trending topics. This involves creating a route that returns the hashtags that have been mentioned the most in the recent posts. Also, implement the functionality for recommending users to follow. This could be based on the number of mutual followers. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery functionality works as expected."], "step": "1. **Setup the project structure and environment:** Start by setting up the project structure.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
