{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\nObjective: Write code for a large system design task.\n\nYou must act autonomously and you will receive no human input at any stage. You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\n         \nWhen writing any code you will always give it in diff format, with line numbers. For example.\nAdding two new lines to a new file is \"\"\"+ 1: import time\n+ : import os\"\"\".\nDeleting a multiple lines from line 5 to 10 is \"\"\"- 5-10\"\"\".\n                          \nWhen modifying code and including new code, you must use the diff format using the line numbers.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou can write to local files, however you cannot use any databases, as none are setup in the local environment.\n                          \nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nYou will get instructions for code to write.\nYou will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.\n\nThink step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.\nFirst lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.\n\nDo not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.\n\nYou will start with the \"entrypoint\" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.\n\nFollow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.\nMake sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.\nWhen writing code if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.\nInclude module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.\n\nUseful to know:\n                            \nAlways use the programming language the user asks for.\nFor Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.\nFor NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.\nAlways add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.\nAdd comments explaining very complex bits of logic.\nAlways follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.\n\n\nPython toolbelt preferences:\n- pytest\n- dataclasses\n\nObjective:```\nWrite complete MVC code for the following system design task. Design Dropbox or Google Drive (A Global File Storage and Sharing Service)\nDesign a file hosting service that allows users to upload, store, share, delete, and download files on their servers and provides synchronization across various devices.\nThings to include:\n* Approach to upload/view/search/share/download files from any device.\n* ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties should be present in the system.\n* Approach to track permission for file sharing.\n* Allowing multiple users to edit the same document.\n* The system should support storing large files up to a GB.\n```\n                            \nUnderstand the problem, by creating a detailed step-by-step plan. Try to solve the problem in the minimal steps necessary. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make excellent code implementation. You can use any package and any other packages you wish to install. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.                              \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "provide_detailed_sub_task_steps_for_sub_agents", "arguments": "{\n  \"steps\": [\n    \"1.
