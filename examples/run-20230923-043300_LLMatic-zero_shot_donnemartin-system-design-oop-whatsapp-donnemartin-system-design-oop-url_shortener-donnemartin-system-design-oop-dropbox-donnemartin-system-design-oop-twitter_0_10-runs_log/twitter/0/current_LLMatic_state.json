You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nIf you are unsure, you can list all available files to view with the `list_files` function.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou can write to local files, however you cannot use any databases, as none are setup in the local environment.\n                               \nIf you want to you can use the python database library of `sqlite3` do not use `SQLAlchemy`.\n\nUse the functions provided.

The platform provides features for both individual users and administrative management.\n\n**1. User Management:**\n1.1. **Registration & Authentication:**  \n- Allow users to register using email, username, and password.\n- Option to reset forgotten passwords.\n- Secure authentication using JWT or similar protocols.\n\n1.2. **Profile Management:**  \n- Users can edit their profile information: profile picture, bio, website link, and location.\n- Option to make profile private or public.\n\n**2. Posting & Content Management:**\n2.1. **Creating Posts (Tweets):**  \n- Allow users to create text-based posts with a limit of 280 characters.\n- Option to include images posts.\n- Users can delete their own posts.\n\n2.2. **Interacting with Posts:**  \n- Users can like, retweet, and reply to posts.\n- Nested comment structure for post replies.\n\n2.3. **Content Filtering & Search:**  \n- Users can search for specific posts or users using keywords.\n- Filter option based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics.\n\n**3. Social Interaction:**\n3.1. **Following & Followers:**  \n- Users can follow/unfollow other users.\n- A timeline view displays posts from followed users.\n- Users receive notifications for new followers.\n\n3.2. **Direct Messaging:**  \n- Private conversation threads between users.\n- Option to block/unblock users from messaging.\n\n3.3. **Notifications:**  \n- Users are notified of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions.\n\n**4. Trending & Discovery:**\n4.1. **Trending Topics:**  \n- System identifies and displays trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions.\n- Trending topics can be sorted based on location or globally.\n\n4.2. **User Recommendations:**  \n- Recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers.\n\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating an extremely detailed detailed step-by-step plan, where each step is long (multiple sentences) and in total includes every single feature requirement specified above, feel free to copy directly from it. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.

Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new directory for the project and initialize it as a Python project. Create subdirectories for the different components of the project such as 'models', 'controllers', 'views', 'tests', and 'utils'. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to manage the project dependencies. The project will need packages like Flask for the web framework, PyJWT for handling JWT authentication, sqlite3 for the database, pytest for testing, and Pillow for handling images.", "2. Define the database schema. The database will have tables for users, posts, comments, likes, retweets, followers, messages, notifications, and trends. Each table will have appropriate fields based on the requirements. For example, the users table will have fields for id, email, username, password, profile picture, bio, website link, location, and privacy setting. The posts table will have fields for id, user_id, text, image, and timestamp. The comments table will have fields for id, post_id, user_id, text, and timestamp. The likes and retweets tables will have fields for id, post_id, and user_id. The followers table will have fields for follower_id and followee_id. The messages table will have fields for id, sender_id, receiver_id, text, and timestamp. The notifications table will have fields for id, user_id, type, and related_id. The trends table will have fields for id, hashtag, count, and timestamp. Write and run tests to ensure that the database schema is correctly defined.", "3. Implement the models for each table in the database. Each model will have methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the corresponding table. For example, the User model will have methods like create_user, get_user, update_user, and delete_user. The Post model will have methods like create_post, get_post, update_post, and delete_post. Similarly, implement models for Comment, Like, Retweet, Follower, Message, Notification, and Trend. Write and run tests to ensure that the models are correctly implemented.", "4. Implement the controllers for handling the business logic of the application. There will be controllers for user management, post management, social interaction, and trending & discovery. The user management controller will handle registration, authentication, profile management, and password reset. The post management controller will handle creating posts, interacting with posts, and content filtering & search. The social interaction controller will handle following & followers, direct messaging, and notifications. The trending & discovery controller will handle trending topics and user recommendations. Write and run tests to ensure that the controllers are correctly implemented.", "5. Implement the views for displaying the user interface of the application. There will be views for the homepage, user registration, user login, user profile, post creation, post interaction, content search, follower management, direct messaging, notifications, trending topics, and user recommendations. Each view will use the corresponding controller to fetch the necessary data from the database and display it to the user. Write and run tests to ensure that the views are correctly implemented.", "6. Implement the routes for handling HTTP requests to the application. There will be routes for user registration, user login, user logout, profile editing, post creation, post deletion, post liking, post retweeting, post replying, content searching, following, unfollowing, sending messages, blocking users, unblocking users, viewing notifications, viewing trending topics, and viewing user recommendations. Each route will use the corresponding view to generate the response to the request. Write and run tests to ensure that the routes are correctly implemented.", "7. Implement the utilities for supporting the application. This includes utilities for handling JWT authentication, password hashing, image processing, email sending, and error handling. Write and run tests to ensure that the utilities are correctly implemented.", "8. Finally, integrate all the components of the application and run the application.
