Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new directory for the project and initialize it as a Python project. Create subdirectories for the different components of the project such as 'models', 'controllers', 'views', 'tests', and 'utils'. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to manage the project dependencies. The project will need packages like Flask for the web framework, PyJWT for handling JWT authentication, sqlite3 for the database, pytest for testing, and Pillow for handling images.", "2. Define the database schema. The database will have tables for users, posts, comments, likes, retweets, followers, messages, notifications, and trends. Each table will have appropriate fields based on the requirements. For example, the users table will have fields for id, email, username, password, profile picture, bio, website link, location, and privacy setting. The posts table will have fields for id, user_id, text, image, and timestamp. The comments table will have fields for id, post_id, user_id, text, and timestamp. The likes and retweets tables will have fields for id, post_id, and user_id. The followers table will have fields for follower_id and followee_id. The messages table will have fields for id, sender_id, receiver_id, text, and timestamp. The notifications table will have fields for id, user_id, type, and related_id. The trends table will have fields for id, hashtag, count, and timestamp. Write and run tests to ensure that the database schema is correctly defined.", "3. Implement the models for each table in the database. Each model will have methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the corresponding table. For example, the User model will have methods like create_user, get_user, update_user, and delete_user. The Post model will have methods like create_post, get_post, update_post, and delete_post. Similarly, implement models for Comment, Like, Retweet, Follower, Message, Notification, and Trend. Write and run tests to ensure that the models are correctly implemented.", "4. Implement the controllers for handling the business logic of the application. There will be controllers for user management, post management, social interaction, and trending & discovery. The user management controller will handle registration, authentication, profile management, and password reset. The post management controller will handle creating posts, interacting with posts, and content filtering & search. The social interaction controller will handle following & followers, direct messaging, and notifications. The trending & discovery controller will handle trending topics and user recommendations. Write and run tests to ensure that the controllers are correctly implemented.", "5. Implement the views for displaying the user interface of the application. There will be views for the homepage, user registration, user login, user profile, post creation, post interaction, content search, follower management, direct messaging, notifications, trending topics, and user recommendations. Each view will use the corresponding controller to fetch the necessary data from the database and display it to the user. Write and run tests to ensure that the views are correctly implemented.", "6. Implement the routes for handling HTTP requests to the application. There will be routes for user registration, user login, user logout, profile editing, post creation, post deletion, post liking, post retweeting, post replying, content searching, following, unfollowing, sending messages, blocking users, unblocking users, viewing notifications, viewing trending topics, and viewing user recommendations. Each route will use the corresponding view to generate the response to the request. Write and run tests to ensure that the routes are correctly implemented.", "7. Implement the utilities for supporting the application. This includes utilities for handling JWT authentication, password hashing, image processing, email sending, and error handling. Write and run tests to ensure that the utilities are correctly implemented.", "8. Finally, integrate all the components of the application and run the application.
