You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nIf you are unsure, you can list all available files to view with the `list_files` function.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou can write to local files, however you cannot use any databases, as none are setup in the local environment.\n                               \nIf you want to you can use the python database library of `sqlite3` do not use `SQLAlchemy`.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nYou will get instructions for code to write.\nFirst lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.\nDo not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.\n\nYou will start with the \"entrypoint\" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.\n\nFollow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.\nMake sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.\nWhen writing code if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.\nInclude module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.\n\nUseful to know:\n\nFor Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.\nAlways add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.\nAdd comments explaining very complex bits of logic.\nAlways follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.\nYou can use any package and any other packages you wish to install.\nIf you want to you can use the python database library of `sqlite3` do not use `SQLAlchemy`.\n\nPython toolbelt preferences:\n- pytest\n- dataclasses\n- sqlite3\n\nObjective:```\n**1.

SharedLinkView", "from .shared_folder_view import SharedFolderView"]}, "steps": ["1. Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new directory named 'cloudsafe'. Inside this directory, create subdirectories named 'models', 'controllers', 'views', 'tests', and 'utils'. The 'models' directory will contain classes representing the data models (User, File, Folder, SharedLink, etc.). The 'controllers' directory will contain the business logic for handling requests and responses. The 'views' directory will contain the code for rendering the user interface. The 'tests' directory will contain all the test cases. The 'utils' directory will contain utility functions and classes that are used across the project. Also, create a file named 'main.py' in the root directory which will serve as the entry point of the application. Finally, create a 'requirements.txt' file in the root directory to list all the Python package dependencies.", "2. Define the User model. In the 'models' directory, create a file named 'user.py'. This file will contain a class named 'User' with attributes for id, name, email, password, profile_picture, and storage_used. The id will be a unique identifier for each user. The name, email, and password will be used for registration and login. The profile_picture will be a URL to the user's profile picture. The storage_used will keep track of the amount of storage used by the user. Also, define methods for registering a new user, authenticating a user, updating a user's profile, and calculating the storage used. After writing the User model, write test cases for it in the 'tests' directory.", "3. Define the File and Folder models. In the 'models' directory, create files named 'file.py' and 'folder.py'. The File class will have attributes for id, name, size, type, upload_date, version, and owner. The owner will be a reference to the User who owns the file. The Folder class will have attributes for id, name, creation_date, and owner. Also, define methods for uploading a file, downloading a file, renaming a file, moving a file, deleting a file, creating a folder, renaming a folder, moving a folder, and deleting a folder. After writing the File and Folder models, write test cases for them in the 'tests' directory.", "4. Define the SharedLink and SharedFolder models. In the 'models' directory, create files named 'shared_link.py' and 'shared_folder.py'. The SharedLink class will have attributes for id, url, expiry_date, password, and file. The file will be a reference to the File that the link points to. The SharedFolder class will have attributes for id, users, permissions, and folder. The users will be a list of Users who have access to the folder. The permissions will be a list of permissions (view, edit, delete) for each user. The folder will be a reference to the Folder that is being shared. Also, define methods for generating a shareable link, setting an expiry date, setting a password, inviting a user to a shared folder, and setting permissions. After writing the SharedLink and SharedFolder models, write test cases for them in the 'tests' directory.", "5. Implement the controllers. In the 'controllers' directory, create files named 'user_controller.py', 'file_controller.py', 'folder_controller.py', 'shared_link_controller.py', and 'shared_folder_controller.py'. Each controller will use the corresponding model to handle requests and responses. For example, the UserController will use the User model to register a new user, authenticate a user, update a user's profile, and calculate the storage used. After writing the controllers, write test cases for them in the 'tests' directory.", "6. Implement the views. In the 'views' directory, create files named 'user_view.py', 'file_view.py', 'folder_view.py', 'shared_link_view.py', and 'shared_folder_view.py'. Each view will use the corresponding controller to render the user interface. For example, the UserView will use the UserController to display the registration form, login form, and user profile. After writing the views, write test cases for them in the 'tests' directory.", "7. Implement the main application. In the 'main.py' file, import the views and set up the routes for the application. For example, the route '/register' will use the UserView to display the registration form and handle the registration request. The route '/login' will use the UserView to display the login form and handle the login request. The route '/profile' will use the UserView to display the user profile and handle the profile update request. Similarly, set up routes for file upload, file download, file rename, file move, file delete, folder create, folder rename, folder move, folder delete, link generate, link expire, link password, folder invite, and folder permission. After writing the main application, write test cases for it in the 'tests' directory.", "8. Run the tests. Use the 'pytest' command to run all the test cases in the 'tests' directory. Make sure all the tests pass. If any test fails, debug the code and fix the issue.", "9. Finally, write the 'requirements.txt' file. List all the Python package dependencies in this file.

Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass. Please be sure to include all of the specified feature requirements in the following plan.\n"}]}
