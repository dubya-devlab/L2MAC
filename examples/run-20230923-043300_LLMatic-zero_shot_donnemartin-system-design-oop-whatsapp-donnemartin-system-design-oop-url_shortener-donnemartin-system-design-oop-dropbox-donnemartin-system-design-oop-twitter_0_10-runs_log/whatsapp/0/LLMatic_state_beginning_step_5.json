After extending the MessageService and UserService, write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features are working correctly.", "10. **Final Testing and Refactoring**: Run all the tests written in the previous steps to ensure that all the features of the chat application are working correctly.

Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.\nWhen writing code if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.\nInclude module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.\n\nUseful to know:\n\nFor Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.\nAlways add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.\nAdd comments explaining very complex bits of logic.\nAlways follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.\nYou can use any package and any other packages you wish to install.\nIf you want to you can use the python database library of `sqlite3` do not use `SQLAlchemy`.\n\nPython toolbelt preferences:\n- pytest\n- dataclasses\n- sqlite3\n\nObjective:```\n**Global Chat Service (GCS)**\n\n**Overview**:  \nA real-time online chat application allowing users to send text messages, images, and create group chats.\n\n**Functional Requirements**:\n\n1. **User Registration and Authentication**:\n    - Sign up using email.\n    - Forgotten password recovery.\n\n2. **User Profile**:\n    - Allow users to set profile pictures and status messages.\n    - Privacy settings for who can see user details or last seen status.\n\n3. **Contact Management**:\n    - Block/unblock contacts.\n    - Create, edit, and manage groups.\n\n4. **Messaging**:\n    - Send and receive real-time text messages.\n    - Message read receipts (blue ticks or equivalent).\n    - End-to-end encryption for security.\n    - Image sharing.\n    - Emojis, GIFs, and stickers support.\n\n5. **Group Chats**:\n    - Create group chats with a name and picture.\n    - Add or remove participants.\n    - Admin roles and permissions.\n\n6. **Status/Story Feature**:\n    - Allow users to post image statuses visible for a limited time.\n    - Control who can see the status.\n\n7. **Web Application**:\n    - Web-based version accessible from browsers.\n\n8. **Connectivity and Offline Mode**:\n    - Message queuing for when the user is offline; messages are sent once connectivity is restored.\n    - Display online/offline status.\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating an extremely detailed detailed step-by-step plan, where each step is long (multiple sentences) and in total includes every single feature requirement specified above, feel free to copy directly from it. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass. Please be sure to include all of the specified feature requirements in the following plan.\n"}]}
