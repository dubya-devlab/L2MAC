Your task is to create a concise running summary of actions and information results in the provided text, focusing on key and potentially important information to remember.

You will receive the current summary and your latest actions. Combine them, adding relevant key information from the latest development in 1st person past tense and keeping the summary concise.

Summary So Far:
"""
I received a message to write an implementation plan to a file named "implementation_plan.txt". The plan includes the following steps: 1. Outline the architecture, 2. Identify core classes and functions, 3. Plan the implementation, 4. Write tests, 5. Implement code, 6. Run tests, 7. Provide complete codebase.

In response to the latest development, I wrote an architecture outline to a file named "architecture_outline.txt". The outline includes the following sections: 1. Frontend - User interface for submitting URLs and displaying shortened URLs, 2. Backend - API for receiving and processing URL requests, URL shortening logic, and a database for storing original and shortened URLs, 3. Tests - Unit tests for core functionality and integration tests for API and database interactions.

Additionally, I wrote core classes and functions to a file named "core_classes_and_functions.txt". The core classes and functions include: 1. URLShortener - shorten_url(original_url: str) -> str, get_original_url(shortened_url: str) -> str, 2. Database - store_url_mapping(original_url: str, shortened_url: str), get_original_url(shortened_url: str) -> str, get_shortened_url(original_url: str) -> str, 3. API - POST /shorten, GET /{shortened_url}.
