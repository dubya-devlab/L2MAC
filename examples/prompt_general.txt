Objective: Write code for a large system design task.

You must act autonomously and you will receive no human input at any stage. You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.
                          
Provide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.

You cannot visualize any graphical output.

You can write to local files, however you cannot use any databases, as none are setup in the local environment.

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including ALL code.
Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that
FILENAME is the lowercase file name including the file extension,
LANG is the markup code block language for the code's language, and CODE is the code:

FILENAME
```LANG
CODE
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
When writing code if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.

Useful to know:
                        
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

Objective:```
Write complete MVC code for the following system design task. Design Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp (A Global Chat Service)
Features to implement: 
1. One-on-one text messaging between users.
2. Support group chats.
3. Delivered and read status
4. Support sending .jpg images between users.
5. End-to-end message encryption.
```
                        
Understand the problem, by creating a detailed step-by-step plan. Try to solve the problem in the minimal steps necessary. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make excellent code implementation. You can use any package and any other packages you wish to install. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.

Complete the first step now.
