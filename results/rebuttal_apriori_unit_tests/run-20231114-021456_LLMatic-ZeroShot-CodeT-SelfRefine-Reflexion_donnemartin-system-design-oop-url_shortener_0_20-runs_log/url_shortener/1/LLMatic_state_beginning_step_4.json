Create a new Python Flask application with the necessary files and directories. The main files will include `app.py` for the Flask application, `models.py` for the data models, `views.py` for the routes and views, and `utils.py` for utility functions. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the Python packages required for this project. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and dataclasses. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the data models in `models.py`. The main data models will include `User`, `URL`, and `Click`. The `User` model will have fields for username and password. The `URL` model will have fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who created it, and the expiration date. The `Click` model will have fields for the URL that was clicked, the date/time of the click, and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing the data models, write tests to ensure that the models are working correctly and can perform CRUD operations.", "Step 3: Implement the URL shortening feature. In `utils.py`, write a function to generate a unique shortened URL. This function will take a URL as input and return a shortened version of it. Also, write a function to validate that a URL is active and legitimate. In `views.py`, create a route where users can input a URL to be shortened. This route will use the functions from `utils.py` to validate the URL and generate a shortened URL. After implementing the URL shortening feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly and can generate unique shortened URLs for valid inputs.", "Step 4: Implement the redirection feature. In `views.py`, create a route that takes a shortened URL as input and redirects to the original URL. This route will use the `URL` model to find the original URL associated with the shortened URL. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly and can correctly redirect to the original URL for valid shortened URLs.", "Step 5: Implement the analytics feature. In `utils.py`, write a function to record a click when a shortened URL is accessed. This function will create a new `Click` instance with the URL, the date/time of the click, and the geographical location of the clicker. In `views.py`, create a route where users can view statistics about their shortened URLs. This route will use the `Click` model to find all clicks associated with a URL and return the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of each clicker. After implementing the analytics feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly and can correctly record and retrieve click data.", "Step 6: Implement the user accounts feature. In `views.py`, create routes for users to create accounts, view all their shortened URLs, edit or delete their shortened URLs, and view analytics for all their shortened URLs. These routes will use the `User` and `URL` models to perform the necessary operations. After implementing the user accounts feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly and can correctly perform all the required operations.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In `views.py`, create routes for administrators to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. These routes will use the `User`, `URL`, and `Click` models to perform the necessary operations. After implementing the admin dashboard feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly and can correctly perform all the required operations.", "Step 8: Implement the expiration feature. In `utils.py`, write a function to check if a shortened URL has expired. This function will take a URL as input and return a boolean indicating whether the URL has expired. In `views.py`, modify the URL shortening route to allow users to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL, and modify the redirection route to use the expiration check function before redirecting. After implementing the expiration feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly and can correctly check for and handle expired URLs.", "Step 9: After implementing all the features, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire system. Use pytest to run all the tests written in the previous steps. Ensure that all tests pass and that the system behaves as expected for a variety of inputs and scenarios.", "Step 10: Finally, prepare the project for deployment. Ensure that all code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices. Create a `README.md` file to document the project, its features, how to run it, and how to run the tests. Also, update the `requirements.txt` file to include any additional packages that were used during development. After preparing the project for deployment, run the tests one last time to ensure that everything is still working correctly."], "step": "Step 5: Implement the analytics feature.
