Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the Python packages required for this project. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and dataclasses. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the data models in the `models.py` file. The main data models will include `User`, `URL`, and `Click`. The `User` model will have fields for username and password. The `URL` model will have fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who created it, and the expiration date. The `Click` model will have fields for the URL that was clicked, the date and time of the click, and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing the data models, write tests to ensure that the models are working correctly and can perform the necessary operations.", "Step 3: Implement the URL shortening feature. This will involve creating a function in the `utils.py` file that takes a URL as input and returns a shortened version of the URL. The function should also validate that the URL is active and legitimate. After implementing the URL shortening feature, write tests to ensure that the function can correctly shorten URLs and validate them.", "Step 4: Implement the redirection feature. This will involve creating a route in the `views.py` file that takes a shortened URL as input and redirects to the original URL. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the analytics feature. This will involve creating a function in the `utils.py` file that takes a shortened URL as input and returns statistics about the URL, such as the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing the analytics feature, write tests to ensure that the function can correctly retrieve and calculate the statistics.", "Step 6: Implement the user accounts feature. This will involve creating routes in the `views.py` file for user registration, login, and logout. It will also involve creating methods in the `User` model for viewing all the user's shortened URLs, editing a URL, and deleting a URL. After implementing the user accounts feature, write tests to ensure that the routes and methods work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard feature. This will involve creating routes in the `views.py` file for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting a URL, and deleting a user account. It will also involve creating methods in the `User` model for these operations. After implementing the admin dashboard feature, write tests to ensure that the routes and methods work correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration feature. This will involve adding a field to the `URL` model for the expiration date/time, and modifying the redirection route to check the expiration date/time before redirecting. After implementing the URL expiration feature, write tests to ensure that the expiration check works correctly.", "Step 9: After implementing all the features, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire system. This will involve running all the tests written in the previous steps, and possibly writing additional tests to cover any areas that were not covered. Ensure that all tests pass.", "Step 10: Finally, prepare the project for deployment.
