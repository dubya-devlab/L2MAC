Create a new Python Flask project and add the necessary files and directories. The main files will include 'app.py' for the Flask application, 'models.py' for the data models, 'views.py' for the routes and views, and 'utils.py' for utility functions. Also, create a 'tests' directory to hold all the test files. Each feature will have its own test file, named 'test_<feature>.py'. After setting up the project structure, create a 'requirements.txt' file and add the necessary dependencies, including Flask, pytest, and any other necessary libraries. Run a test to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and that all the necessary dependencies are installed.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. In 'models.py', create a 'URL' data class with fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, and any other necessary information. In 'utils.py', create a function to generate a unique shortened URL. This function should take a URL as input, validate it, and return a unique shortened URL. In 'views.py', create a route for users to input a URL to be shortened. This route should call the URL shortening function and return the shortened URL. Write tests for the URL shortening feature and run them to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In 'views.py', create a route for the shortened URL. This route should look up the original URL associated with the shortened URL and redirect to it. Write tests for the redirection feature and run them to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. In 'models.py', add fields to the 'URL' data class to store analytics data, such as the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. In 'utils.py', create functions to update the analytics data each time a shortened URL is clicked and to retrieve the analytics data for a given URL. In 'views.py', create a route for users to view the analytics for their shortened URLs. Write tests for the analytics feature and run them to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. In 'models.py', create a 'User' data class with fields for the username, password, and a list of the user's shortened URLs. In 'utils.py', create functions to create a new user, authenticate a user, and manage a user's shortened URLs. In 'views.py', create routes for users to create accounts, log in, view their shortened URLs, and edit or delete their shortened URLs. Write tests for the user accounts feature and run them to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In 'models.py', create an 'Admin' data class that inherits from the 'User' data class and adds additional admin-specific fields and methods. In 'utils.py', create functions for admin-specific tasks, such as viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. In 'views.py', create routes for the admin dashboard. Write tests for the admin dashboard feature and run them to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the URL expiration feature. In 'models.py', add a field to the 'URL' data class to store the expiration date/time of the shortened URL. In 'utils.py', create a function to check whether a shortened URL has expired. This function should be called each time a shortened URL is accessed. If the URL has expired, the function should return an error message instead of redirecting to the original URL. Write tests for the URL expiration feature and run them to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 8: After implementing all the features, run a comprehensive set of tests to ensure that all the features are working together correctly. These tests should cover all the functional requirements specified in the task description. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues until all the tests pass.", "Step 9: Once all the tests pass, perform a code review to ensure that the code follows best practices for Python and Flask. Check for things like proper use of data classes, appropriate separation of concerns between models, views, and utilities, and efficient and readable code. Make any necessary revisions to the code.", "Step 10: Finally, prepare the project for deployment. This may involve setting up a production server, configuring the server to run the Flask application, and setting up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Run a final set of tests to ensure that the application works correctly in the production environment."], "step": "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature.
