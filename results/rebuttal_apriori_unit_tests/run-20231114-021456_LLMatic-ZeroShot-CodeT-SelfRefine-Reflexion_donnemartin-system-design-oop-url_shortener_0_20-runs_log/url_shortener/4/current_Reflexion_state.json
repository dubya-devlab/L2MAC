Users can input a URL to be shortened.\n   - [ ] 1.2. The system validates that the URL is active and legitimate.\n   - [ ] 1.3. The system generates a unique shortened URL.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Users can choose custom short links (subject to availability).\n\n2. **Redirection**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Accessing the shortened URL redirects to the original URL.\n\n3. **Analytics**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 3.2. View number of clicks.\n   - [ ] 3.3. View date/time of each click.\n   - [ ] 3.4. View geographical location of the clicker.\n\n4. **User Accounts**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can create accounts.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Account holders can view all their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Account holders can edit or delete their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.4. Account holders can view analytics for all their shortened URLs.\n\n5. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Administrators can view all shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Administrators can delete any URL or user account.\n   - [ ] 5.3. Administrators can monitor system performance and analytics.\n\n6. **Expiration**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Users can set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL.\n```\n\nThe generated code only implements two of the original features specified: URL shortening and redirection. The other features such as analytics, user accounts, admin dashboard, and URL expiration are not implemented in the code. \n\nTo address this, the new plan would be to incrementally add the missing features. First, we can start by implementing the user accounts feature. This would involve creating a User class and a mock users database. We would also need to add routes for user registration and login. \n\nNext, we can add the analytics feature. This would involve tracking each click on a shortened URL and storing this data in the mock database. We would also need to add a route for users to view their URL analytics.\n\nAfter that, we can implement the admin dashboard feature. This would involve adding routes for administrators to view all URLs and user accounts, and to delete any URL or user account.\n\nFinally, we can implement the URL expiration feature. This would involve adding an expiration date to the URL class and checking this date before redirecting a shortened URL.\n\nThroughout this process, we should also write tests for each new feature to ensure they are working as expected.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, redirect\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\nimport datetime\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n# Mock database\\nurls_db = {}\\nusers_db = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tusername: str\\n\\tpassword: str\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass URL:\\n\\toriginal_url: str\\n\\tshort_url: str\\n\\tuser: User\\n\\texpiration_date: datetime.datetime\\n\\n@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])\\ndef register():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = User(data['username'], data['password'])\\n\\tusers_db[user.username] = user\\n\\treturn {'message': 'User registered successfully'}, 201\\n\\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\\ndef login():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users_db.get(data['username'])\\n\\tif user and user.password == data['password']:\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'Login successful'}, 200\\n\\treturn {'message': 'Invalid username or password'}, 401\\n\\n@app.route('/shorten', methods=['POST'])\\ndef shorten_url():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users_db.get(data['username'])\\n\\tif not user:\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'User not found'}, 404\\n\\turl = URL(data['original_url'], data['short_url'], user, data['expiration_date'])\\n\\turls_db[url.short_url] = url\\n\\treturn {'message': 'URL shortened successfully'}, 201\\n\\n@app.route('/<short_url>', methods=['GET'])\\ndef redirect_url(short_url):\\n\\turl = urls_db.get(short_url)\\n\\tif not url or url.expiration_date < datetime.datetime.now():\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'URL not found or expired'}, 404\\n\\treturn redirect(url.original_url, code=302)\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nfrom flask import json\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\ndef test_register(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/register', data=json.dumps({'username': 'test', 'password': 'test'}), content_type='application/json')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'User registered successfully'}\\n\\ndef test_login(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/login', data=json.dumps({'username': 'test', 'password': 'test'}), content_type='application/json')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'Login successful'}\\n\\ndef test_shorten_url(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/shorten', data=json.dumps({'username': 'test', 'original_url': 'https://www.google.com', 'short_url': 'goog', 'expiration_date': '2022-12-31T23:59:59Z'}), content_type='application/json')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'URL shortened successfully'}\\n\\ndef test_redirect_url(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/goog')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 302\\n\\tassert response.headers['Location'] == 'https://www.google.com'\\n\\ndef test_expired_url(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/expired')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 404\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'URL not found or expired'}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.

Users can input a URL to be shortened.\n   - [ ] 1.2. The system validates that the URL is active and legitimate.\n   - [ ] 1.3. The system generates a unique shortened URL.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Users can choose custom short links (subject to availability).\n\n2. **Redirection**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Accessing the shortened URL redirects to the original URL.\n\n3. **Analytics**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 3.2. View number of clicks.\n   - [ ] 3.3. View date/time of each click.\n   - [ ] 3.4. View geographical location of the clicker.\n\n4. **User Accounts**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can create accounts.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Account holders can view all their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Account holders can edit or delete their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.4. Account holders can view analytics for all their shortened URLs.\n\n5. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Administrators can view all shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Administrators can delete any URL or user account.\n   - [ ] 5.3. Administrators can monitor system performance and analytics.\n\n6. **Expiration**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Users can set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL.\n```\n\nThe generated code only implements two of the original features specified: URL shortening and redirection. The other features such as analytics, user accounts, admin dashboard, and URL expiration are not implemented in the code. \n\nTo address this, the new plan would be to incrementally add the missing features. First, we can start by implementing the user accounts feature. This would involve creating a User class and a mock users database. We would also need to add routes for user registration and login. \n\nNext, we can add the analytics feature. This would involve tracking each click on a shortened URL and storing this data in the mock database. We would also need to add a route for users to view their URL analytics.\n\nAfter that, we can implement the admin dashboard feature. This would involve adding routes for administrators to view all URLs and user accounts, and to delete any URL or user account.\n\nFinally, we can implement the URL expiration feature. This would involve adding an expiration date to the URL class and checking this date before redirecting a shortened URL.\n\nThroughout this process, we should also write tests for each new feature to ensure they are working as expected.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, redirect\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\nimport datetime\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n# Mock database\\nurls_db = {}\\nusers_db = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tusername: str\\n\\tpassword: str\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass URL:\\n\\toriginal_url: str\\n\\tshort_url: str\\n\\tuser: User\\n\\texpiration_date: datetime.datetime\\n\\n@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])\\ndef register():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = User(data['username'], data['password'])\\n\\tusers_db[user.username] = user\\n\\treturn {'message': 'User registered successfully'}, 201\\n\\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\\ndef login():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users_db.get(data['username'])\\n\\tif user and user.password == data['password']:\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'Login successful'}, 200\\n\\treturn {'message': 'Invalid username or password'}, 401\\n\\n@app.route('/shorten', methods=['POST'])\\ndef shorten_url():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users_db.get(data['username'])\\n\\tif not user:\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'User not found'}, 404\\n\\turl = URL(data['original_url'], data['short_url'], user, data['expiration_date'])\\n\\turls_db[url.short_url] = url\\n\\treturn {'message': 'URL shortened successfully'}, 201\\n\\n@app.route('/<short_url>', methods=['GET'])\\ndef redirect_url(short_url):\\n\\turl = urls_db.get(short_url)\\n\\tif not url or url.expiration_date < datetime.datetime.now():\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'URL not found or expired'}, 404\\n\\treturn redirect(url.original_url, code=302)\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nfrom flask import json\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\ndef test_register(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/register', data=json.dumps({'username': 'test', 'password': 'test'}), content_type='application/json')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'User registered successfully'}\\n\\ndef test_login(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/login', data=json.dumps({'username': 'test', 'password': 'test'}), content_type='application/json')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'Login successful'}\\n\\ndef test_shorten_url(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/shorten', data=json.dumps({'username': 'test', 'original_url': 'https://www.google.com', 'short_url': 'goog', 'expiration_date': '2022-12-31T23:59:59Z'}), content_type='application/json')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'URL shortened successfully'}\\n\\ndef test_redirect_url(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/goog')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 302\\n\\tassert response.headers['Location'] == 'https://www.google.com'\\n\\ndef test_expired_url(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/expired')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 404\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'URL not found or expired'}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.
