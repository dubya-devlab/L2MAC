You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided.

Users can input a URL to be shortened.\n   - [ ] 1.2. The system validates that the URL is active and legitimate.\n   - [ ] 1.3. The system generates a unique shortened URL.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Users can choose custom short links (subject to availability).\n\n2. **Redirection**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Accessing the shortened URL redirects to the original URL.\n\n3. **Analytics**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 3.2. View number of clicks.\n   - [ ] 3.3. View date/time of each click.\n   - [ ] 3.4. View geographical location of the clicker.\n\n4. **User Accounts**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can create accounts.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Account holders can view all their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Account holders can edit or delete their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.4. Account holders can view analytics for all their shortened URLs.\n\n5. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Administrators can view all shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Administrators can delete any URL or user account.\n   - [ ] 5.3. Administrators can monitor system performance and analytics.\n\n6. **Expiration**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Users can set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL.\n```\n\nOnce the code is complete it will be unit tested against the following tests, it ideally should pass all tests:```\nimport pytest\nfrom random import randint, choices\nimport string\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Helper Functions\ndef random_url():\n    return f\"https://example{randint(1000, 9999)}.com\"\n\ndef random_username():\n    return 'user' + ''.join(choices(string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits, k=5))\n\ndef random_slug():\n    return ''.join(choices(string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits, k=8))\n\n# Test Functions\nclass TestURLShorteningService:\n\n    def test_input_url_shortening(self):\n        url = random_url()\n        shortened_url = shorten_url(url)\n        assert isinstance(shortened_url, str)\n        assert len(shortened_url) < len(url)\n\n    def test_url_validation(self):\n        valid_url = random_url()\n        invalid_url = \"htp:/invalid\" + ''.join(choices(string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits, k=10))\n        assert validate_url(valid_url) is True\n        assert validate_url(invalid_url) is False\n\n    def test_unique_shortened_url(self):\n        url = random_url()\n        shortened_url1 = shorten_url(url)\n        shortened_url2 = shorten_url(url)\n        assert shortened_url1 != shortened_url2\n\n    def test_custom_short_link(self):\n        url = random_url()\n        custom_slug = random_slug()\n        custom_short_url = shorten_url(url, custom_slug)\n        assert custom_slug in custom_short_url\n\n    def test_redirection(self):\n        original_url = random_url()\n        shortened_url = shorten_url(original_url)\n        redirected_url = redirect(shortened_url)\n        assert redirected_url == original_url\n\n    def test_analytics_retrieval(self):\n        shortened_url = shorten_url(random_url())\n        analytics = get_analytics(shortened_url)\n        assert 'clicks' in analytics\n        assert 'click_dates' in analytics\n        assert 'click_geolocations' in analytics\n\n    def test_user_account_functions(self):\n        username = random_username()\n        user = create_user(username, \"password\")\n        assert user is not None\n        urls = user.get_shortened_urls()\n        assert isinstance(urls, list)\n        user.edit_url(\"old_short_url\", \"new_short_url\")\n        assert \"new_short_url\" in user.get_shortened_urls()\n        user.delete_url(\"new_short_url\")\n        assert \"new_short_url\" not in user.get_shortened_urls()\n        analytics = user.get_analytics(\"short_url\")\n        assert analytics is not None\n\n    def test_admin_functions(self):\n        admin = create_admin(\"admin_username\", \"admin_password\")\n        all_urls = admin.get_all_urls()\n        assert isinstance(all_urls, list)\n        admin.delete_url(\"some_short_url\")\n        assert \"some_short_url\" not in admin.get_all_urls()\n        admin.delete_user(\"username\")\n        assert admin.get_user(\"username\") is None\n        system_stats = admin.get_system_stats()\n        assert system_stats is not None\n\n    def test_url_expiration(self):\n        url = random_url()\n        expiration_time = datetime.now() + timedelta(minutes=randint(1, 60))\n        shortened_url = shorten_url(url, expiration_time=expiration_time)\n        assert check_expiration(shortened_url) is False\n        # Additional code to simulate waiting until after expiration may be required\n\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating an extremely detailed step-by-step plan, where each step is long (multiple sentences) and in total includes every single feature requirement specified above, feel free to copy directly from it. Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass. Please be sure to include all of the specified feature requirements in the following plan.\n", "function_call": {"name": "provide_detailed_sub_task_steps_for_sub_agents"}}], "base_dialog": [], "sub_messages": [], "message_hash": "fb6dd23c70ff62f688018ee36d5bd16584747313271a42e466d596f056519bc9"}
