Create a new Python Flask project and set up the necessary files and directories. The main files will include `app.py` for the Flask application, `models.py` for the data models, `views.py` for the routes and views, and `utils.py` for utility functions. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and any other necessary packages. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and that all necessary files and directories exist.", "Step 2: Define the data models in `models.py`. The data models will include `User`, `URL`, and `Click`. The `User` model will have fields for username, password, and a list of URLs. The `URL` model will have fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who created it, the creation date, the expiration date, and a list of clicks. The `Click` model will have fields for the URL, the date/time of the click, and the geographical location of the clicker. After defining the data models, write tests to ensure that the data models are defined correctly and that all necessary fields exist.", "Step 3: Implement the URL shortening functionality in `utils.py`. This will include functions to validate a URL, generate a unique shortened URL, and optionally allow users to choose a custom short link. After implementing the URL shortening functionality, write tests to ensure that the URL shortening functionality works correctly. The tests should check that the functions correctly validate URLs, generate unique shortened URLs, and allow users to choose custom short links.", "Step 4: Implement the redirection functionality in `views.py`. This will involve creating a route that takes a shortened URL, looks up the corresponding original URL, and redirects to it. After implementing the redirection functionality, write tests to ensure that the redirection functionality works correctly. The tests should check that accessing a shortened URL correctly redirects to the original URL.", "Step 5: Implement the analytics functionality in `utils.py`. This will include functions to record a click when a shortened URL is accessed, and retrieve statistics about a shortened URL. The statistics should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of each clicker. After implementing the analytics functionality, write tests to ensure that the analytics functionality works correctly. The tests should check that the functions correctly record clicks and retrieve statistics.", "Step 6: Implement the user account functionality in `views.py`. This will involve creating routes to allow users to create accounts, view their shortened URLs, edit their shortened URLs, delete their shortened URLs, and view analytics for their shortened URLs. After implementing the user account functionality, write tests to ensure that the user account functionality works correctly. The tests should check that users can correctly create accounts, view their shortened URLs, edit their shortened URLs, delete their shortened URLs, and view analytics for their shortened URLs.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard functionality in `views.py`. This will involve creating routes to allow administrators to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing the admin dashboard functionality, write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functionality works correctly. The tests should check that administrators can correctly view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics.", "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration functionality in `utils.py`.

After implementing the URL expiration functionality, write tests to ensure that the URL expiration functionality works correctly. The tests should check that the function correctly determines whether a shortened URL has expired.", "Step 9: Integrate all the functionalities in `app.py`.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
