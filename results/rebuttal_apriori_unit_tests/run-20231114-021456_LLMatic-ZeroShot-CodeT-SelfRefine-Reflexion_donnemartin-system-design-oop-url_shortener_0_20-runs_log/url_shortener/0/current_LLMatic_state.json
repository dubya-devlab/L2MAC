The main files will include `app.py` for the Flask application, `models.py` for the data models, `views.py` for the routes and views, and `utils.py` for utility functions. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and any other necessary packages. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and that all necessary files and directories exist.", "Step 2: Define the data models in `models.py`. The data models will include `User`, `URL`, and `Click`. The `User` model will have fields for username, password, and a list of URLs. The `URL` model will have fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who created it, the creation date, the expiration date, and a list of clicks. The `Click` model will have fields for the URL, the date/time of the click, and the geographical location of the clicker. After defining the data models, write tests to ensure that the data models are defined correctly and that all necessary fields exist.", "Step 3: Implement the URL shortening functionality in `utils.py`. This will include functions to validate a URL, generate a unique shortened URL, and optionally allow users to choose a custom short link. After implementing the URL shortening functionality, write tests to ensure that the URL shortening functionality works correctly. The tests should check that the functions correctly validate URLs, generate unique shortened URLs, and allow users to choose custom short links.", "Step 4: Implement the redirection functionality in `views.py`. This will involve creating a route that takes a shortened URL, looks up the corresponding original URL, and redirects to it. After implementing the redirection functionality, write tests to ensure that the redirection functionality works correctly. The tests should check that accessing a shortened URL correctly redirects to the original URL.", "Step 5: Implement the analytics functionality in `utils.py`. This will include functions to record a click when a shortened URL is accessed, and retrieve statistics about a shortened URL. The statistics should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of each clicker. After implementing the analytics functionality, write tests to ensure that the analytics functionality works correctly. The tests should check that the functions correctly record clicks and retrieve statistics.", "Step 6: Implement the user account functionality in `views.py`. This will involve creating routes to allow users to create accounts, view their shortened URLs, edit their shortened URLs, delete their shortened URLs, and view analytics for their shortened URLs. After implementing the user account functionality, write tests to ensure that the user account functionality works correctly. The tests should check that users can correctly create accounts, view their shortened URLs, edit their shortened URLs, delete their shortened URLs, and view analytics for their shortened URLs.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard functionality in `views.py`. This will involve creating routes to allow administrators to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing the admin dashboard functionality, write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functionality works correctly. The tests should check that administrators can correctly view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics.", "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration functionality in `utils.py`. This will include a function to check whether a shortened URL has expired. After implementing the URL expiration functionality, write tests to ensure that the URL expiration functionality works correctly. The tests should check that the function correctly determines whether a shortened URL has expired.", "Step 9: Integrate all the functionalities in `app.py`.

Users can input a URL to be shortened.\n   - [ ] 1.2. The system validates that the URL is active and legitimate.\n   - [ ] 1.3. The system generates a unique shortened URL.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Users can choose custom short links (subject to availability).\n\n2. **Redirection**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Accessing the shortened URL redirects to the original URL.\n\n3. **Analytics**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 3.2. View number of clicks.\n   - [ ] 3.3. View date/time of each click.\n   - [ ] 3.4. View geographical location of the clicker.\n\n4. **User Accounts**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can create accounts.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Account holders can view all their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Account holders can edit or delete their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.4. Account holders can view analytics for all their shortened URLs.\n\n5. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Administrators can view all shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Administrators can delete any URL or user account.\n   - [ ] 5.3. Administrators can monitor system performance and analytics.\n\n6. **Expiration**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Users can set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL.\n```\n\nOnce the code is complete it will be unit tested against the following tests, it ideally should pass all tests:```\nimport pytest\nfrom random import randint, choices\nimport string\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Helper Functions\ndef random_url():\n    return f\"https://example{randint(1000, 9999)}.com\"\n\ndef random_username():\n    return 'user' + ''.join(choices(string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits, k=5))\n\ndef random_slug():\n    return ''.join(choices(string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits, k=8))\n\n# Test Functions\nclass TestURLShorteningService:\n\n    def test_input_url_shortening(self):\n        url = random_url()\n        shortened_url = shorten_url(url)\n        assert isinstance(shortened_url, str)\n        assert len(shortened_url) < len(url)\n\n    def test_url_validation(self):\n        valid_url = random_url()\n        invalid_url = \"htp:/invalid\" + ''.join(choices(string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits, k=10))\n        assert validate_url(valid_url) is True\n        assert validate_url(invalid_url) is False\n\n    def test_unique_shortened_url(self):\n        url = random_url()\n        shortened_url1 = shorten_url(url)\n        shortened_url2 = shorten_url(url)\n        assert shortened_url1 != shortened_url2\n\n    def test_custom_short_link(self):\n        url = random_url()\n        custom_slug = random_slug()\n        custom_short_url = shorten_url(url, custom_slug)\n        assert custom_slug in custom_short_url\n\n    def test_redirection(self):\n        original_url = random_url()\n        shortened_url = shorten_url(original_url)\n        redirected_url = redirect(shortened_url)\n        assert redirected_url == original_url\n\n    def test_analytics_retrieval(self):\n        shortened_url = shorten_url(random_url())\n        analytics = get_analytics(shortened_url)\n        assert 'clicks' in analytics\n        assert 'click_dates' in analytics\n        assert 'click_geolocations' in analytics\n\n    def test_user_account_functions(self):\n        username = random_username()\n        user = create_user(username, \"password\")\n        assert user is not None\n        urls = user.get_shortened_urls()\n        assert isinstance(urls, list)\n        user.edit_url(\"old_short_url\", \"new_short_url\")\n        assert \"new_short_url\" in user.get_shortened_urls()\n        user.delete_url(\"new_short_url\")\n        assert \"new_short_url\" not in user.get_shortened_urls()\n        analytics = user.get_analytics(\"short_url\")\n        assert analytics is not None\n\n    def test_admin_functions(self):\n        admin = create_admin(\"admin_username\", \"admin_password\")\n        all_urls = admin.get_all_urls()\n        assert isinstance(all_urls, list)\n        admin.delete_url(\"some_short_url\")\n        assert \"some_short_url\" not in admin.get_all_urls()\n        admin.delete_user(\"username\")\n        assert admin.get_user(\"username\") is None\n        system_stats = admin.get_system_stats()\n        assert system_stats is not None\n\n    def test_url_expiration(self):\n        url = random_url()\n        expiration_time = datetime.now() + timedelta(minutes=randint(1, 60))\n        shortened_url = shorten_url(url, expiration_time=expiration_time)\n        assert check_expiration(shortened_url) is False\n        # Additional code to simulate waiting until after expiration may be required\n\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating an extremely detailed step-by-step plan, where each step is long (multiple sentences) and in total includes every single feature requirement specified above, feel free to copy directly from it.
