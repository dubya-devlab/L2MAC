The main reason for this is that the code generation focused on creating the basic data models and some administrative functions, but did not implement the majority of the user-facing features such as search, categorization, user accounts and profiles, ratings and reviews, community features, and recipe recommendations.\n\nTo mitigate this, the new plan would be to focus on implementing these user-facing features. This would involve creating additional methods in the User and Recipe classes to handle actions such as searching for recipes, managing user accounts and profiles, rating and reviewing recipes, following other users, and receiving recipe recommendations. Additionally, more complex features such as recipe categorization and a feed of recent activity would likely require the creation of new classes and data structures. The implementation of these features would also need to be accompanied by comprehensive tests to ensure their functionality.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests.
