Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. The project will be structured as a Flask application, with separate modules for each major feature. Create the following files: `app.py` (the main application file), `models.py` (for the data models), `views.py` (for the routes and views), and `utils.py` (for utility functions). Also create a `requirements.txt` file to list the project dependencies. Write the basic setup code in `app.py` and `views.py`, and define the data models in `models.py`. The data models should include `User`, `Recipe`, `Review`, `Rating`, and `Category`. Each model should have appropriate fields and methods for the required functionality. For example, the `User` model should have fields for username, password, and favorite recipes, and methods for creating an account, changing password, and saving favorite recipes. The `Recipe` model should have fields for title, ingredients, instructions, image, categories, and reviews, and methods for submitting, editing, and deleting recipes. The `Review` and `Rating` models should have fields for user, recipe, and content or score, and methods for submitting reviews or ratings. The `Category` model should have a field for name and a method for searching recipes by category. After writing the code, write tests to check that the models are correctly defined and the methods work as expected. Run the tests using pytest.", "2. Implement the recipe submission and management features. In `views.py`, define routes for submitting, editing, and deleting recipes. The submission route should accept POST requests with recipe data, create a new `Recipe` instance, and save it to the database. The edit and delete routes should accept POST requests with recipe ID and new data or DELETE requests with recipe ID, respectively, and update or delete the corresponding `Recipe` instance. In `utils.py`, write a function for validating recipe format. This function should check that all required fields are present and non-empty. Use this function in the submission and edit routes to validate the incoming data. After writing the code, write tests to check that the routes work as expected and the validation function correctly identifies valid and invalid recipes. Run the tests using pytest.", "3. Implement the search and categorization features. In `views.py`, define a route for searching recipes. This route should accept GET requests with a search query, and return a list of `Recipe` instances that match the query. The matching should be done based on recipe name, ingredients, and categories. Also define a route for getting recipes by category. This route should accept GET requests with a category name, and return a list of `Recipe` instances that belong to the category. After writing the code, write tests to check that the search and categorization routes return the correct results. Run the tests using pytest.", "4. Implement the user accounts and profiles features. In `views.py`, define routes for creating an account, logging in, logging out, changing password, and viewing profile. The create account and login routes should accept POST requests with username and password, and create a new `User` instance or authenticate an existing one, respectively. The logout route should clear the current user session. The change password route should accept POST requests with old and new passwords, and update the `User` instance's password. The profile route should accept GET requests, and return the `User` instance's submitted recipes and favorite recipes. After writing the code, write tests to check that the account and profile routes work as expected. Run the tests using pytest.", "5. Implement the ratings and reviews features. In `views.py`, define routes for submitting reviews and ratings. These routes should accept POST requests with recipe ID and review or rating content, and create new `Review` or `Rating` instances, respectively. Also define a route for getting a recipe's average rating. This route should accept GET requests with recipe ID, and return the average score of all `Rating` instances for the recipe. After writing the code, write tests to check that the review and rating routes work as expected and the average rating is correctly calculated. Run the tests using pytest.", "6. Implement the community features. In `views.py`, define routes for following users and getting the feed. The follow route should accept POST requests with the ID of the user to follow, and add the user to the current `User` instance's following list. The feed route should accept GET requests, and return a list of recent activities of the current `User` instance's followed users. The activities should include new recipes and ratings. After writing the code, write tests to check that the follow and feed routes work as expected and the feed includes the correct activities. Run the tests using pytest.", "7. Implement the admin dashboard features. In `views.py`, define routes for managing recipes and monitoring site usage. The manage recipes route should accept POST requests with recipe ID and new data, and update the corresponding `Recipe` instance. The monitor site usage route should accept GET requests, and return statistics such as total number of users and recipes. After writing the code, write tests to check that the admin routes work as expected and the statistics are correctly calculated. Run the tests using pytest.", "8. Implement the recipe recommendations feature. In `views.py`, define a route for getting recipe recommendations. This route should accept GET requests, and return a list of `Recipe` instances that are recommended for the current `User` instance. The recommendations should be based on the user's preferences and past activity. After writing the code, write tests to check that the recommendations route returns the correct results. Run the tests using pytest.", "9. Implement the notifications feature. In `views.py`, define a route for getting notifications. This route should accept GET requests, and return a list of notifications for the current `User` instance. The notifications should include new recipes in the user's interest areas. After writing the code, write tests to check that the notifications route returns the correct results. Run the tests using pytest.", "10. Finally, implement the recipe sharing feature. In `views.py`, define a route for sharing recipes on social media. This route should accept POST requests with recipe ID and platform name, and return a success message. After writing the code, write tests to check that the sharing route works as expected. Run the tests using pytest."], "step": "2. Implement the recipe submission and management features. In `views.py`, define routes for submitting, editing, and deleting recipes. The submission route should accept POST requests with recipe data, create a new `Recipe` instance, and save it to the database. The edit and delete routes should accept POST requests with recipe ID and new data or DELETE requests with recipe ID, respectively, and update or delete the corresponding `Recipe` instance.
