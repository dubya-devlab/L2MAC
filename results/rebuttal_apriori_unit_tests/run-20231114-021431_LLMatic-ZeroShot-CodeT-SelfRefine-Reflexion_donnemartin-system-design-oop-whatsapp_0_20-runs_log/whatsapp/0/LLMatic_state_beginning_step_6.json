["Step 1: Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. The project will be divided into several modules, each responsible for a specific functionality. The modules will include: `auth_service` for user registration and authentication, `user_service` for user profile management, `contact_service` for contact management, `message_service` for messaging, `group_service` for group chats, `status_service` for status/story feature, `web_app_service` for web application, and `offline_service` for connectivity and offline mode. Each module will be represented by a Python file. Also, create a `main.py` file which will serve as the entry point of the application. After setting up the project structure, create a `requirements.txt` file and add the necessary dependencies such as Flask and pytest. Finally, create a test file for each module, named `test_<module_name>.py`. Run pytest to ensure that the project setup is correct and all files are properly created.", "Step 2: Implement the `auth_service` module. This module will handle user registration and authentication. It will have two main functions: `sign_up(email, password)` and `recover_password(email)`. The `sign_up` function will take an email and password as input, and register a new user. The `recover_password` function will take an email as input, and initiate the password recovery process for the user associated with that email. For the purpose of this task, you can mock the database with an in-memory dictionary to store user data. After implementing the `auth_service` module, write tests in the `test_auth_service.py` file to test the `sign_up` and `recover_password` functions. Run pytest to ensure that the `auth_service` module is working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the `user_service` module. This module will handle user profile management. It will have two main functions: `set_profile(user_id, picture_path, status_message)` and `set_privacy(user_id, privacy_settings)`. The `set_profile` function will take a user_id, picture_path, and status_message as input, and update the user's profile picture and status message. The `set_privacy` function will take a user_id and privacy_settings as input, and update the user's privacy settings. After implementing the `user_service` module, write tests in the `test_user_service.py` file to test the `set_profile` and `set_privacy` functions. Run pytest to ensure that the `user_service` module is working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the `contact_service` module. This module will handle contact management. It will have two main functions: `block_contact(user_id, contact_id)` and `unblock_contact(user_id, contact_id)`. The `block_contact` function will take a user_id and contact_id as input, and block the contact for the user. The `unblock_contact` function will take a user_id and contact_id as input, and unblock the contact for the user. After implementing the `contact_service` module, write tests in the `test_contact_service.py` file to test the `block_contact` and `unblock_contact` functions. Run pytest to ensure that the `contact_service` module is working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the `message_service` module. This module will handle messaging. It will have several functions including `send_message(sender_id, receiver_id, message)`, `receive_message(receiver_id)`, `mark_as_read(receiver_id, message_id)`, `encrypt_message(sender_id, message)`, `decrypt_message(receiver_id, encrypted_message)`, `send_image(sender_id, receiver_id, image_path)`, `receive_image(receiver_id)`, and `send_content(sender_id, receiver_id, content)`. After implementing the `message_service` module, write tests in the `test_message_service.py` file to test all the functions. Run pytest to ensure that the `message_service` module is working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the `group_service` module. This module will handle group chats. It will have several functions including `create_group(user_id, group_name)`, `edit_group(user_id, group_id, new_group_name)`, `add_participant(group_id, participant_id)`, `remove_participant(group_id, participant_id)`, `assign_admin(group_id, user_id)`, and `change_admin_permissions(group_id, user_id, new_permissions)`. After implementing the `group_service` module, write tests in the `test_group_service.py` file to test all the functions. Run pytest to ensure that the `group_service` module is working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the `status_service` module. This module will handle the status/story feature. It will have two main functions: `post_image_status(user_id, image_status, duration)` and `set_status_visibility(user_id, visibility_settings)`. The `post_image_status` function will take a user_id, image_status, and duration as input, and post an image status for the user. The `set_status_visibility` function will take a user_id and visibility_settings as input, and update the user's status visibility settings. After implementing the `status_service` module, write tests in the `test_status_service.py` file to test the `post_image_status` and `set_status_visibility` functions. Run pytest to ensure that the `status_service` module is working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the `web_app_service` module. This module will handle the web application. It will have one main function: `access_web_version(user_id)`. The `access_web_version` function will take a user_id as input, and allow the user to access the web version of the chat application. After implementing the `web_app_service` module, write tests in the `test_web_app_service.py` file to test the `access_web_version` function. Run pytest to ensure that the `web_app_service` module is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the `offline_service` module. This module will handle connectivity and offline mode. It will have several functions including `set_offline(user_id)`, `set_online(user_id)`, `send_message(sender_id, receiver_id, message)`, and `check_message_sent(sender_id, receiver_id)`. The `set_offline` and `set_online` functions will take a user_id as input, and set the user's status to offline or online, respectively. The `send_message` function will take a sender_id, receiver_id, and message as input, and send a message from the sender to the receiver. If the sender is offline, the message will be queued and sent once the sender is online. The `check_message_sent` function will take a sender_id and receiver_id as input, and check if the queued messages from the sender to the receiver have been sent. After implementing the `offline_service` module, write tests in the `test_offline_service.py` file to test all the functions. Run pytest to ensure that the `offline_service` module is working correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, integrate all the modules in the `main.py` file. The `main.py` file will import all the modules and provide an interface for the user to interact with the chat application. After integrating all the modules, run the `main.py` file to ensure that the chat application is working correctly. Also, run pytest on all the test files to ensure that all the modules are working correctly and all the tests are passing."], "step": "Step 7: Implement the `status_service` module.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
