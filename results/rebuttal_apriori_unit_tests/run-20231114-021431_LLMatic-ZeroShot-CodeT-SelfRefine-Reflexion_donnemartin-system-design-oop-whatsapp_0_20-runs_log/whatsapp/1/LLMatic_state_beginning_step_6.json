The project will be divided into several modules: `auth`, `user`, `contact`, `message`, `group`, `status`, `web_app`, and `offline`. Each module will have its own Python file and a corresponding test file. The `auth` module will handle user registration and authentication. The `user` module will manage user profiles and privacy settings. The `contact` module will handle contact management. The `message` module will manage messaging, including text messages, image sharing, and support for emojis, GIFs, and stickers. The `group` module will handle group chats. The `status` module will manage the status/story feature. The `web_app` module will handle the web application. The `offline` module will manage connectivity and offline mode. Create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. After setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files, run a test to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and all files are in the correct locations.", "Step 2: Implement the `auth` module. This module will have two main functions: `sign_up` and `recover_password`. The `sign_up` function will take an email and password as input and add the user to a mock database. The `recover_password` function will take an email as input and return a password recovery link. After implementing the `auth` module, write tests for the `sign_up` and `recover_password` functions and run these tests to ensure that the functions are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the `user` module. This module will have two main functions: `set_profile` and `set_privacy`. The `set_profile` function will take a user ID, picture path, and status message as input and update the user's profile in the mock database. The `set_privacy` function will take a user ID and privacy setting as input and update the user's privacy settings in the mock database. After implementing the `user` module, write tests for the `set_profile` and `set_privacy` functions and run these tests to ensure that the functions are working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the `contact` module. This module will have two main functions: `block_contact` and `unblock_contact`. Both functions will take a user ID and contact ID as input. The `block_contact` function will block the contact for the user in the mock database, and the `unblock_contact` function will unblock the contact for the user in the mock database. After implementing the `contact` module, write tests for the `block_contact` and `unblock_contact` functions and run these tests to ensure that the functions are working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the `message` module. This module will have several functions to handle messaging, including `send_message`, `receive_message`, `mark_as_read`, `encrypt_message`, `decrypt_message`, `send_image`, `receive_image`, `send_content`, and `receive_content`. After implementing the `message` module, write tests for all the functions and run these tests to ensure that the functions are working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the `group` module. This module will have several functions to handle group chats, including `create_group`, `edit_group`, `add_participant`, `remove_participant`, `assign_admin`, and `change_admin_permissions`. After implementing the `group` module, write tests for all the functions and run these tests to ensure that the functions are working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the `status` module. This module will have two main functions: `post_image_status` and `set_status_visibility`. The `post_image_status` function will take a user ID, image status, and duration as input and post the image status for the user in the mock database. The `set_status_visibility` function will take a user ID and visibility setting as input and update the user's status visibility in the mock database. After implementing the `status` module, write tests for the `post_image_status` and `set_status_visibility` functions and run these tests to ensure that the functions are working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the `web_app` module. This module will have one main function: `access_web_version`. The `access_web_version` function will take a user ID as input and return a link to the web version of the chat application. After implementing the `web_app` module, write a test for the `access_web_version` function and run this test to ensure that the function is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the `offline` module. This module will have several functions to handle connectivity and offline mode, including `set_offline`, `set_online`, `send_message`, and `check_message_sent`. After implementing the `offline` module, write tests for all the functions and run these tests to ensure that the functions are working correctly.", "Step 10: After implementing all the modules and running all the tests, perform a final review of the code to ensure that it meets all the functional requirements. Check that all functions are implemented correctly and that all tests pass. If any issues are found, debug the code and rerun the tests until all issues are resolved and all tests pass."], "step": "Step 7: Implement the `status` module.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
