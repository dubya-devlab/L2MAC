Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. The main files will include `app.py` (the main application file), `models.py` (for data models), `views.py` (for routes and views), and `utils.py` (for utility functions). Also, create a `tests` directory for all the test files. Setup a virtual environment and install necessary packages including Flask, pytest, and PyJWT. Create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the dependencies. After setting up, write a test to ensure the Flask application runs correctly.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** In the `models.py` file, define a User class with attributes such as id, username, email, and password. Implement a function `register_user` in `utils.py` to register a new user.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
