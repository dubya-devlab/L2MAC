Run the test to confirm that the setup is correct.", "Step 2: Implement the User Accounts and Profiles feature. Create a User class with attributes for username, password, submitted recipes, and favorite recipes. The User class should have methods for creating and managing accounts, and saving favorite recipes. Write tests for the User class to ensure that the methods are working as expected. Run the tests to confirm that the User class is correctly implemented.", "Step 3: Implement the Recipe Submission and Management feature. Create a Recipe class with attributes for ingredients, instructions, images, and categorization options. The Recipe class should have methods for submitting, editing, and deleting recipes, and for validating the recipe format. Write tests for the Recipe class to ensure that the methods are working as expected. Run the tests to confirm that the Recipe class is correctly implemented.", "Step 4: Implement the Search and Categorization feature.

Add methods to the User class for following other users or chefs, and for displaying a feed showing recent activity of followed users. Add a method to the Recipe class for sharing recipes on social media platforms. Write tests for these new methods to ensure that they are working as expected. Run the tests to confirm that the Community Features are correctly implemented.", "Step 7: Implement the Admin Dashboard feature. Create an Admin class that inherits from the User class and has additional methods for managing all submitted recipes and removing inappropriate content. Add a method to the User class for monitoring site usage statistics and user engagement. Write tests for the Admin class and the new method in the User class to ensure that they are working as expected. Run the tests to confirm that the Admin Dashboard feature is correctly implemented.", "Step 8: Implement the Recipe Recommendations feature.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
