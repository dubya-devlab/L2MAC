The main dependencies will be Flask for the web framework and pytest for testing. Write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and the necessary dependencies are installed. Run the test to confirm that the setup is correct.", "Step 2: Implement the User Accounts and Profiles feature. Create a User class with attributes such as username, password, email, submitted_recipes, and favorite_recipes. The submitted_recipes and favorite_recipes attributes will be lists that store the IDs of the respective recipes. Implement methods for creating and managing user accounts. Write tests to ensure that user accounts can be created, and that users can manage their accounts. Run the tests to confirm that the User class and its methods are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the Recipe Submission and Management feature. Create a Recipe class with attributes such as name, ingredients, instructions, images, and categories. Implement methods for submitting, editing, and deleting recipes. Write tests to ensure that recipes can be submitted, edited, and deleted. Run the tests to confirm that the Recipe class and its methods are working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the Search and Categorization feature. Create a Search class with methods for searching recipes based on ingredients, recipe name, or categories. Also, implement a method for categorizing recipes by type, cuisine, or dietary needs. Write tests to ensure that the search and categorization features are working correctly. Run the tests to confirm that the Search class and its methods are working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the Ratings and Reviews feature. Create a Rating class with attributes such as user_id, recipe_id, and rating. Also, create a Review class with attributes such as user_id, recipe_id, and review. Implement methods for rating and reviewing recipes. Write tests to ensure that users can rate and review recipes. Run the tests to confirm that the Rating and Review classes and their methods are working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the Community Features. Create a Follow class with attributes such as follower_id and followee_id. Implement methods for following and unfollowing users. Also, create a Feed class with methods for showing recent activity of followed users. Write tests to ensure that users can follow and unfollow other users, and that the feed shows the correct recent activity. Run the tests to confirm that the Follow and Feed classes and their methods are working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the Admin Dashboard feature. Create an Admin class with methods for managing all submitted recipes and removing inappropriate content. Also, implement a method for monitoring site usage statistics and user engagement. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard features are working correctly. Run the tests to confirm that the Admin class and its methods are working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the Recipe Recommendations feature. Create a Recommendation class with methods for generating recipe recommendations based on user preferences and past activity. Also, implement a method for notifying users of new recipes in their interest areas. Write tests to ensure that the recipe recommendations and notifications are working correctly. Run the tests to confirm that the Recommendation class and its methods are working correctly.", "Step 9: Integrate all the features and classes into the main.py file.

It includes features for categorizing recipes, user ratings and reviews, and personal recipe management.\n\n**Functional Requirements to implement**:\n\n1. **Recipe Submission and Management**:\n   - [ ] 1.1. Users can submit recipes with ingredients, instructions, and images.\n   - [ ] 1.2. Recipe submissions include options for categorization (e.g., cuisine type, dietary restrictions).\n   - [ ] 1.3. Users can edit or delete their submitted recipes.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Recipe format validation to ensure complete information.\n\n2. **Search and Categorization**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Users can search for recipes based on ingredients, recipe name, or categories.\n   - [ ] 2.2. Categorization of recipes by type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner), cuisine, or dietary needs (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).\n\n3. **User Accounts and Profiles**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can create and manage accounts.\n   - [ ] 3.2. Account holders can save favorite recipes.\n   - [ ] 3.3. Profile pages showing submitted recipes and favorite recipes.\n\n4. **Ratings and Reviews**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can rate recipes on a 5-star scale.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Users can write reviews for recipes.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Display of average rating on recipe pages.\n\n5. **Community Features**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Users can follow other users or chefs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Feed showing recent activity of followed users (new recipes, ratings).\n   - [ ] 5.3. Option to share recipes on social media platforms.\n\n6. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Administrators can manage all submitted recipes.\n   - [ ] 6.2. Administrators can remove inappropriate content.\n   - [ ] 6.3. Monitoring of site usage statistics and user engagement.\n\n7. **Recipe Recommendations**:\n   - [ ] 7.1. System generates recipe recommendations based on user preferences and past activity.\n   - [ ] 7.2. Users receive notifications for new recipes in their interest areas.\n\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating an extremely detailed step-by-step plan, where each step is long (multiple sentences) and in total includes every single feature requirement specified above, feel free to copy directly from it. Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
