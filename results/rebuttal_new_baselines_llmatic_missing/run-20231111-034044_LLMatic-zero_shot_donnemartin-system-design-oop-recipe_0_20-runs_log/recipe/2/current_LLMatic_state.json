After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and run the test.", "Step 2: Implement the User Accounts and Profiles feature. Create a User class in a user.py file. The User class should have attributes for username, password, submitted recipes, and favorite recipes. Implement methods for creating and managing accounts. Also, implement a method for a user to save a favorite recipe. After implementing the User class, write tests to ensure that the User class is working as expected and run the tests.", "Step 3: Implement the Recipe Submission and Management feature. Create a Recipe class in a recipe.py file. The Recipe class should have attributes for recipe name, ingredients, instructions, images, and categorization options. Implement methods for submitting, editing, and deleting recipes. Also, implement a method for validating the recipe format.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
