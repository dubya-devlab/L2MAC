Users can create a new event, specifying details like event type, date, and time.\n   - [ ] 1.2. The system allows for customization of events (e.g., themes, color schemes).\n   - [ ] 1.3. Users can update or modify event details as needed.\n   - [ ] 1.4. A calendar view is available for users to manage multiple events.\n\n2. **Venue Sourcing**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Users can search for venues based on location, capacity, and type.\n   - [ ] 2.2. Integration of maps for venue locations.\n   - [ ] 2.3. Users can book venues directly through the application.\n\n3. **Guest List Management**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can create and manage guest lists.\n   - [ ] 3.2. Import/export guest list feature.\n   - [ ] 3.3. RSVP tracking and management.\n\n4. **Vendor Coordination**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Platform to connect with various event service providers (caterers, decorators).\n   - [ ] 4.2. Users can view and compare vendor profiles and reviews.\n   - [ ] 4.3. In-app messaging system for vendor communication.\n\n5. **Budget Management**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Users can set a budget for the event.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Budget tracking and breakdown by categories (venue, catering, etc.).\n   - [ ] 5.3. Alerts for budget overruns.\n\n6. **User Accounts and Profiles**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Users can create personal profiles.\n   - [ ] 6.2. Profile customization to reflect event planning preferences.\n   - [ ] 6.3. Saving and accessing past and upcoming events.\n\n7. **Notifications and Reminders**:\n   - [ ] 7.1. Automated email/SMS notifications for event milestones.\n   - [ ] 7.2. Customizable reminders for tasks and deadlines.\n\n8. **Reporting and Analytics**:\n   - [ ] 8.1. Generate reports on event success metrics (attendance, budget adherence).\n   - [ ] 8.2. Feedback collection from guests and vendors post-event.\n\n9. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 9.1. Administrators can monitor and manage user activities.\n   - [ ] 9.2. System performance analytics and user engagement statistics.\n   - [ ] 9.3. Manage vendor listings and platform content. \n\n10. **Security and Data Privacy**:\n    - [ ] 10.1.
