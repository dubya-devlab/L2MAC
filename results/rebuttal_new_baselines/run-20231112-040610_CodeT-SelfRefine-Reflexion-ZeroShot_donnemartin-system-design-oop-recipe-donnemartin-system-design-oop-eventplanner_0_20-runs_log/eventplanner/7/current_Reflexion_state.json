The tests were not isolated, meaning the state of the DB in one test affected the state in the other tests. This is why the test_get_events and test_delete_event tests failed. The test_get_events test failed because the events were not in the same order as expected. The test_delete_event test failed because the event was not deleted from the DB as expected.\n\nPlan: To mitigate this issue, I will modify the tests to reset the state of the DB before each test. This will ensure that each test starts with a clean state and is not affected by the state from the previous tests. I will also modify the test_get_events test to not depend on the order of the events. For the test_delete_event test, I will investigate why the event was not deleted from the DB as expected and make necessary changes to the delete_event function in the app.py file.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"requirements.txt\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"flask\\npytest\\ndataclasses\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n# Mock database\\nDB = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Event:\\n\\tid: int\\n\\ttype: str\\n\\tdate: str\\n\\ttime: str\\n\\ttheme: str\\n\\tcolor_scheme: str\\n\\n@app.route('/event', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_event():\\n\\tevent = Event(**request.json)\\n\\tDB[event.id] = event\\n\\treturn {'message': 'Event created', 'event': event.__dict__}, 201\\n\\n@app.route('/event/<int:event_id>', methods=['GET'])\\ndef get_event(event_id):\\n\\tevent = DB.get(event_id)\\n\\tif event:\\n\\t\\treturn {'event': event.__dict__}\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'Event not found'}, 404\\n\\n@app.route('/event/<int:event_id>', methods=['DELETE'])\\ndef delete_event(event_id):\\n\\tif event_id in DB:\\n\\t\\tdel DB[event_id]\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'Event deleted'}\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'Event not found'}, 404\\n\\n@app.route('/events', methods=['GET'])\\ndef get_events():\\n\\treturn {'events': [event.__dict__ for event in DB.values()]}\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\n\\n@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)\\ndef reset_db():\\n\\t# Reset the DB before each test\\n\\tapp.DB = {}\\n\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('event', [\\n\\t{'id': 1, 'type': 'Birthday', 'date': '2022-12-12', 'time': '18:00', 'theme': 'Space', 'color_scheme': 'Blue'},\\n\\t{'id': 2, 'type': 'Wedding', 'date': '2023-01-01', 'time': '12:00', 'theme': 'Garden', 'color_scheme': 'Green'}\\n])\\ndef test_create_event(client, event):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/event', json=event)\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.json == {'message': 'Event created', 'event': event}\\n\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('event_id', [1, 2])\\ndef test_get_event(client, event_id):\\n\\tresponse = client.get(f'/event/{event_id}')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.json == {'event': app.DB[event_id].__dict__}\\n\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('event_id', [1, 2])\\ndef test_delete_event(client, event_id):\\n\\tresponse = client.delete(f'/event/{event_id}')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.json == {'message': 'Event deleted'}\\n\\tassert event_id not in app.DB\\n\\ndef test_get_events(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/events')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert set(event['id'] for event in response.json['events']) == set(app.DB.keys())\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.

This tool should provide functionalities for selecting event types, managing guest lists, sourcing venues, and coordinating with service providers.\n\n**Functional Requirements to Implement**:\n\n1. **Event Creation and Management**:\n   - [ ] 1.1. Users can create a new event, specifying details like event type, date, and time.\n   - [ ] 1.2. The system allows for customization of events (e.g., themes, color schemes).\n   - [ ] 1.3. Users can update or modify event details as needed.\n   - [ ] 1.4. A calendar view is available for users to manage multiple events.\n\n2. **Venue Sourcing**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Users can search for venues based on location, capacity, and type.\n   - [ ] 2.2. Integration of maps for venue locations.\n   - [ ] 2.3. Users can book venues directly through the application.\n\n3. **Guest List Management**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can create and manage guest lists.\n   - [ ] 3.2. Import/export guest list feature.\n   - [ ] 3.3. RSVP tracking and management.\n\n4. **Vendor Coordination**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Platform to connect with various event service providers (caterers, decorators).\n   - [ ] 4.2. Users can view and compare vendor profiles and reviews.\n   - [ ] 4.3. In-app messaging system for vendor communication.\n\n5. **Budget Management**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Users can set a budget for the event.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Budget tracking and breakdown by categories (venue, catering, etc.).\n   - [ ] 5.3. Alerts for budget overruns.\n\n6. **User Accounts and Profiles**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Users can create personal profiles.\n   - [ ] 6.2. Profile customization to reflect event planning preferences.\n   - [ ] 6.3. Saving and accessing past and upcoming events.\n\n7. **Notifications and Reminders**:\n   - [ ] 7.1. Automated email/SMS notifications for event milestones.\n   - [ ] 7.2. Customizable reminders for tasks and deadlines.\n\n8. **Reporting and Analytics**:\n   - [ ] 8.1. Generate reports on event success metrics (attendance, budget adherence).\n   - [ ] 8.2. Feedback collection from guests and vendors post-event.\n\n9. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 9.1. Administrators can monitor and manage user activities.\n   - [ ] 9.2. System performance analytics and user engagement statistics.\n   - [ ] 9.3. Manage vendor listings and platform content. \n\n10. **Security and Data Privacy**:\n    - [ ] 10.1. Ensuring user data protection and privacy.\n    - [ ] 10.2. Secure payment gateway integration for transactions.\n```\n\nThe failure in the previous code generation was due to the fact that the tests were not correctly designed to handle the state of the mock database (DB). The tests were not isolated, meaning the state of the DB in one test affected the state in the other tests. This is why the test_get_events and test_delete_event tests failed. The test_get_events test failed because the events were not in the same order as expected. The test_delete_event test failed because the event was not deleted from the DB as expected.\n\nPlan: To mitigate this issue, I will modify the tests to reset the state of the DB before each test. This will ensure that each test starts with a clean state and is not affected by the state from the previous tests. I will also modify the test_get_events test to not depend on the order of the events. For the test_delete_event test, I will investigate why the event was not deleted from the DB as expected and make necessary changes to the delete_event function in the app.py file.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"requirements.txt\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"flask\\npytest\\ndataclasses\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n# Mock database\\nDB = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Event:\\n\\tid: int\\n\\ttype: str\\n\\tdate: str\\n\\ttime: str\\n\\ttheme: str\\n\\tcolor_scheme: str\\n\\n@app.route('/event', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_event():\\n\\tevent = Event(**request.json)\\n\\tDB[event.id] = event\\n\\treturn {'message': 'Event created', 'event': event.__dict__}, 201\\n\\n@app.route('/event/<int:event_id>', methods=['GET'])\\ndef get_event(event_id):\\n\\tevent = DB.get(event_id)\\n\\tif event:\\n\\t\\treturn {'event': event.__dict__}\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'Event not found'}, 404\\n\\n@app.route('/event/<int:event_id>', methods=['DELETE'])\\ndef delete_event(event_id):\\n\\tif event_id in DB:\\n\\t\\tdel DB[event_id]\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'Event deleted'}\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'Event not found'}, 404\\n\\n@app.route('/events', methods=['GET'])\\ndef get_events():\\n\\treturn {'events': [event.__dict__ for event in DB.values()]}\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\n\\n@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)\\ndef reset_db():\\n\\t# Reset the DB before each test\\n\\tapp.DB = {}\\n\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('event', [\\n\\t{'id': 1, 'type': 'Birthday', 'date': '2022-12-12', 'time': '18:00', 'theme': 'Space', 'color_scheme': 'Blue'},\\n\\t{'id': 2, 'type': 'Wedding', 'date': '2023-01-01', 'time': '12:00', 'theme': 'Garden', 'color_scheme': 'Green'}\\n])\\ndef test_create_event(client, event):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/event', json=event)\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.json == {'message': 'Event created', 'event': event}\\n\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('event_id', [1, 2])\\ndef test_get_event(client, event_id):\\n\\tresponse = client.get(f'/event/{event_id}')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.json == {'event': app.DB[event_id].__dict__}\\n\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('event_id', [1, 2])\\ndef test_delete_event(client, event_id):\\n\\tresponse = client.delete(f'/event/{event_id}')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.json == {'message': 'Event deleted'}\\n\\tassert event_id not in app.DB\\n\\ndef test_get_events(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/events')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert set(event['id'] for event in response.json['events']) == set(app.DB.keys())\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.
