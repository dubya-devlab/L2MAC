Users can submit recipes with ingredients, instructions, and images.\n   - [ ] 1.2. Recipe submissions include options for categorization (e.g., cuisine type, dietary restrictions).\n   - [ ] 1.3. Users can edit or delete their submitted recipes.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Recipe format validation to ensure complete information.\n\n2. **Search and Categorization**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Users can search for recipes based on ingredients, recipe name, or categories.\n   - [ ] 2.2. Categorization of recipes by type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner), cuisine, or dietary needs (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).\n\n3. **User Accounts and Profiles**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can create and manage accounts.\n   - [ ] 3.2. Account holders can save favorite recipes.\n   - [ ] 3.3.

Users can write reviews for recipes.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Display of average rating on recipe pages.\n\n5. **Community Features**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Users can follow other users or chefs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Feed showing recent activity of followed users (new recipes, ratings).\n   - [ ] 5.3. Option to share recipes on social media platforms.\n\n6. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Administrators can manage all submitted recipes.\n   - [ ] 6.2. Administrators can remove inappropriate content.\n   - [ ] 6.3. Monitoring of site usage statistics and user engagement.\n\n7. **Recipe Recommendations**:\n   - [ ] 7.1.

Users receive notifications for new recipes in their interest areas.\n\n```\n\nThe failure in the previous code generation was due to the mutable default list in the User dataclass for the 'favorites' attribute. In Python, mutable defaults for class attributes can lead to unexpected behavior, as they are shared across all instances of the class. This is why the error \"mutable default <class 'list'> for field favorites is not allowed: use default_factory\" was raised.\n\nTo mitigate this, the 'favorites' attribute in the User dataclass should be initialized with a default_factory that returns a new list for each instance of the class. This can be done using the field function from the dataclasses module with default_factory=list as an argument.\n\nThe test cases also failed because they tried to access the 'users' and 'recipes' dictionaries which are defined in the services module, but not in the test_services module. To fix this, these dictionaries should be imported into the test_services module.\n\nThe new high level plan would be:\n\n1. Update the User dataclass to initialize the 'favorites' attribute with a default_factory that returns a new list.\n2. Import the 'users' and 'recipes' dictionaries into the test_services module.\n3. Update the test cases to reflect these changes.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
