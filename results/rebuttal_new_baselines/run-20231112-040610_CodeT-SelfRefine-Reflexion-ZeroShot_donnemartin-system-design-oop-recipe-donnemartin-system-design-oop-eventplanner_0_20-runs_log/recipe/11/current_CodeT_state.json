It includes features for categorizing recipes, user ratings and reviews, and personal recipe management.\n\n**Functional Requirements to implement**:\n\n1. **Recipe Submission and Management**:\n   - [ ] 1.1. Users can submit recipes with ingredients, instructions, and images.\n   - [ ] 1.2. Recipe submissions include options for categorization (e.g., cuisine type, dietary restrictions).\n   - [ ] 1.3. Users can edit or delete their submitted recipes.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Recipe format validation to ensure complete information.\n\n2. **Search and Categorization**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Users can search for recipes based on ingredients, recipe name, or categories.\n   - [ ] 2.2. Categorization of recipes by type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner), cuisine, or dietary needs (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).\n\n3. **User Accounts and Profiles**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can create and manage accounts.\n   - [ ] 3.2. Account holders can save favorite recipes.\n   - [ ] 3.3. Profile pages showing submitted recipes and favorite recipes.\n\n4. **Ratings and Reviews**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can rate recipes on a 5-star scale.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Users can write reviews for recipes.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Display of average rating on recipe pages.\n\n5. **Community Features**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Users can follow other users or chefs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Feed showing recent activity of followed users (new recipes, ratings).\n   - [ ] 5.3. Option to share recipes on social media platforms.\n\n6. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Administrators can manage all submitted recipes.\n   - [ ] 6.2. Administrators can remove inappropriate content.\n   - [ ] 6.3. Monitoring of site usage statistics and user engagement.\n\n7. **Recipe Recommendations**:\n   - [ ] 7.1. System generates recipe recommendations based on user preferences and past activity.\n   - [ ] 7.2. Users receive notifications for new recipes in their interest areas.\n\n```\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}], "base_dialog": [], "sub_messages": []}
