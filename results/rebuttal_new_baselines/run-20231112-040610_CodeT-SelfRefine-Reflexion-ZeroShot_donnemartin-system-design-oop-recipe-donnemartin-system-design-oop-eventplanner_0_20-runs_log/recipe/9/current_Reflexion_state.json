Users can submit recipes with ingredients, instructions, and images.\n   - [ ] 1.2. Recipe submissions include options for categorization (e.g., cuisine type, dietary restrictions).\n   - [ ] 1.3.

Categorization of recipes by type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner), cuisine, or dietary needs (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).\n\n3. **User Accounts and Profiles**:\n   - [ ] 3.1.

The code does not implement features such as user login, recipe search, recipe rating, and many others. \n\nTo mitigate this, a new plan could be to break down the task into smaller subtasks, each focusing on a specific feature. For example, one subtask could be to implement user login, another to implement recipe search, and so on. This way, each feature can be developed and tested individually, ensuring that all the specified features are implemented in the final code. \n\nAdditionally, the code could be improved by adding more comprehensive tests. Currently, the tests only check if the creation of users, recipes, and reviews is successful. However, they do not check if the created objects are correctly stored in the database or if they can be retrieved later. Adding these tests would help ensure the correctness of the code.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\nusers = {}\\nrecipes = {}\\nreviews = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tname: str\\n\\temail: str\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Recipe:\\n\\ttitle: str\\n\\tinstructions: str\\n\\tingredients: str\\n\\tuser: User\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Review:\\n\\tuser: User\\n\\trecipe: Recipe\\n\\tcomment: str\\n\\n@app.route('/user', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_user():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = User(name=data['name'], email=data['email'])\\n\\tusers[user.email] = user\\n\\treturn {'message': 'User created successfully'}, 201\\n\\n@app.route('/recipe', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_recipe():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users.get(data['user_email'])\\n\\trecipe = Recipe(title=data['title'], instructions=data['instructions'], ingredients=data['ingredients'], user=user)\\n\\trecipes[recipe.title] = recipe\\n\\treturn {'message': 'Recipe created successfully'}, 201\\n\\n@app.route('/review', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_review():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users.get(data['user_email'])\\n\\trecipe = recipes.get(data['recipe_title'])\\n\\treview = Review(user=user, recipe=recipe, comment=data['comment'])\\n\\treviews[(user.email, recipe.title)] = review\\n\\treturn {'message': 'Review created successfully'}, 201\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\n\\ndef test_create_user(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/user', json={'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'User created successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_create_recipe(client):\\n\\tclient.post('/user', json={'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'})\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/recipe', json={'title': 'Pasta', 'instructions': 'Boil water.
