Users can submit recipes with ingredients, instructions, and images.\n   - [ ] 1.2. Recipe submissions include options for categorization (e.g., cuisine type, dietary restrictions).\n   - [ ] 1.3. Users can edit or delete their submitted recipes.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Recipe format validation to ensure complete information.\n\n2. **Search and Categorization**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Users can search for recipes based on ingredients, recipe name, or categories.\n   - [ ] 2.2. Categorization of recipes by type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner), cuisine, or dietary needs (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).\n\n3. **User Accounts and Profiles**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can create and manage accounts.\n   - [ ] 3.2. Account holders can save favorite recipes.\n   - [ ] 3.3.

The Flask request object was not imported, causing an undefined variable error. Additionally, the Flask app instance from the app.py file was incorrectly referenced, causing a no-member error.\n\nTo mitigate this, the plan would be to modify the test_app.py file to correctly import and use the Flask request object. Also, the Flask app instance should be correctly referenced from the app.py file. This involves changing the Flask route implementations from `@app.route('/user', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_user():\\n\\tdata = json.loads(request.data)\\n\\tuser = User(**data)\\n\\treturn {'id': user.id}, 201` to `@app.route('/user', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_user():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = User(**data)\\n\\treturn {'id': user.id}, 201`. This should resolve the issue and allow the pytest to pass successfully.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
