You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data.
