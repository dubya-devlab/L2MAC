However, it did not implement the chat features such as sending and receiving messages, blocking and unblocking contacts, creating, editing, and deleting groups, and posting and deleting status updates. This is likely because the task was too complex to be completed in one step.\n\nPlan: The task should be broken down into smaller sub-tasks. First, implement the user management features. Then, implement the chat features one by one, starting with sending and receiving messages. After that, implement the contact management features such as blocking and unblocking contacts. Finally, implement the group and status features. This way, the task becomes more manageable and it's easier to ensure that all features are implemented correctly.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
