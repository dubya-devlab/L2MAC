However, the other features such as profile picture, status message, and privacy settings were not implemented in the initial code generation. The dataclass for User does include these features, but there were no routes or methods in the Flask application that allow for these features to be used or modified.\n\nThe possible reason for this discrepancy could be that the initial code generation focused on the core functionality of user authentication, which is a critical component of any social media application. However, it did not take into account the additional features that enhance the user experience and provide more functionality to the application.\n\nTo mitigate this, the new plan would be to add routes and methods for updating the user's profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. This would involve creating new POST routes for each feature that accept the necessary data and update the corresponding attribute of the User instance. Additionally, tests would need to be written for these new routes to ensure they are working as expected. This approach would ensure that all the specified features are implemented in the code.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
