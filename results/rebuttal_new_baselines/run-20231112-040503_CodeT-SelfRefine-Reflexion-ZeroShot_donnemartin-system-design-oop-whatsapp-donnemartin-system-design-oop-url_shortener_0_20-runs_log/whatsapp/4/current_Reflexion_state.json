The advanced features such as profile picture, status message, privacy settings, contacts, and groups were defined in the User class but no endpoints were created to handle these features. \n\nTo improve, the plan would be to create additional endpoints for each of these features. For example, an endpoint to update the user's profile picture, another to update the status message, and so on. Additionally, the contacts and groups could be implemented as separate classes with their own endpoints for adding and removing contacts or groups. This would ensure that all the specified features are fully implemented in the code. \n\nThe tests would also need to be updated to cover these new features. Each endpoint should have at least one test to ensure it is working as expected. The tests should cover both the happy path and any error conditions that could occur. \n\nFinally, the code should be refactored to improve its structure and readability. This could involve breaking up large functions into smaller ones, adding comments to explain complex sections of code, and ensuring that the code follows the Python style guide.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests.
