This results in an empty chat, and when the tests try to send a message to the chat or view messages from the chat, they fail because there are no messages in the chat.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, I would modify the 'create_chat' function to automatically add the creating user to the chat. This would ensure that there is at least one user in the chat when it is created, and would allow messages to be sent and viewed. I would also update the tests to reflect this change, and to ensure that they correctly test the functionality of the chat application.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests.
