Users can input a URL to be shortened.\n   - [ ] 1.2. The system validates that the URL is active and legitimate.\n   - [ ] 1.3. The system generates a unique shortened URL.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Users can choose custom short links (subject to availability).\n\n2. **Redirection**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Accessing the shortened URL redirects to the original URL.\n\n3. **Analytics**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 3.2. View number of clicks.\n   - [ ] 3.3. View date/time of each click.\n   - [ ] 3.4. View geographical location of the clicker.\n\n4. **User Accounts**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can create accounts.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Account holders can view all their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Account holders can edit or delete their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.4. Account holders can view analytics for all their shortened URLs.\n\n5. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Administrators can view all shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Administrators can delete any URL or user account.\n   - [ ] 5.3. Administrators can monitor system performance and analytics.\n\n6. **Expiration**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Users can set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL.\n```\n\nThe generated code only implements two of the original features specified: URL shortening and redirection. The other features such as analytics, user accounts, admin dashboard, and expiration of URLs are not implemented. \n\nThe possible reason for this discrepancy could be the complexity of the task and the time constraints. Implementing all the features would require a more complex system design, including user authentication, database management, and more advanced routing.\n\nTo mitigate this, a new plan could be devised as follows:\n\n1. Break down the task into smaller subtasks, each focusing on one feature. This would make the task more manageable and allow for more focused coding and testing.\n2. Start with the basic features (URL shortening and redirection), which have already been implemented.\n3. Next, implement the user accounts feature. This would involve creating a user dataclass, a register route, and a login route.\n4. Then, implement the analytics feature. This would involve tracking each click on a shortened URL and storing this data in the URL dataclass.\n5. After that, implement the admin dashboard. This would involve creating an admin dataclass and routes for viewing all URLs and user accounts, and deleting any URL or user account.\n6. Finally, implement the URL expiration feature. This would involve adding an expiration date to the URL dataclass and checking this date each time a shortened URL is accessed.\n7. After each feature is implemented, write tests to ensure it works correctly.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
