Users can input a URL to be shortened.\n   - [ ] 1.2. The system validates that the URL is active and legitimate.\n   - [ ] 1.3. The system generates a unique shortened URL.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Users can choose custom short links (subject to availability).\n\n2. **Redirection**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Accessing the shortened URL redirects to the original URL.\n\n3. **Analytics**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 3.2. View number of clicks.\n   - [ ] 3.3. View date/time of each click.\n   - [ ] 3.4. View geographical location of the clicker.\n\n4. **User Accounts**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can create accounts.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Account holders can view all their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Account holders can edit or delete their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.4. Account holders can view analytics for all their shortened URLs.\n\n5. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Administrators can view all shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Administrators can delete any URL or user account.\n   - [ ] 5.3. Administrators can monitor system performance and analytics.\n\n6. **Expiration**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Users can set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL.\n```\n\nThe failure in the previous code generation was due to an undefined variable 'datetime' in the 'app.py' file. This was used to compare the expiration date of the URL and to record the click time in the click data. However, the 'datetime' module was not imported, leading to an error.\n\nTo mitigate this, the plan would be to import the 'datetime' module in the 'app.py' file. This would allow the use of 'datetime.now()' to get the current date and time. The code would then be able to compare the expiration date of the URL with the current date and time, and record the click time in the click data.\n\nAdditionally, the test for the redirection feature failed because the status code returned was 404 instead of the expected 302. This could be due to the URL not being found in the database or the URL being expired. To fix this, the test could be updated to create the URL before attempting to access it, ensuring that the URL exists and is not expired at the time of the test.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "\n{\n
