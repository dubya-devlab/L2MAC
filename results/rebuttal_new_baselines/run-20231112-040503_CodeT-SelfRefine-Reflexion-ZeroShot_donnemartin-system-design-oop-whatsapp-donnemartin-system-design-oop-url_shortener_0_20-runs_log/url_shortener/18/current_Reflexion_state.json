Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"models.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tid: str\\n\\tusername: str\\n\\tpassword: str\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass UrlData:\\n\\tid: str\\n\\toriginal_url: str\\n\\tshortened_url: str\\n\\tuser_id: str\\n\\tclicks: int\\n\\texpiration_date: str\\n\\tgeographical_location: str\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"auth.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\\nfrom models import User\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\nusers = {}\\n\\n@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])\\ndef register():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tusername = data['username']\\n\\tpassword = data['password']\\n\\tif username in users:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Username already exists'}), 400\\n\\tuser = User(id=len(users), username=username, password=password)\\n\\tusers[username] = user\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'User registered successfully'}), 200\\n\\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\\ndef login():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tusername = data['username']\\n\\tpassword = data['password']\\n\\tuser = users.get(username)\\n\\tif not user or user.password != password:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Invalid username or password'}), 400\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Logged in successfully'}), 200\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"url_shortener.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, redirect\\nfrom models import UrlData\\nfrom auth import users\\nimport datetime\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\nurl_data = {}\\n\\n@app.route('/shorten_url', methods=['POST'])\\ndef shorten_url():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\toriginal_url = data['original_url']\\n\\tshortened_url = data.get('shortened_url', str(len(url_data)))\\n\\tuser_id = data.get('user_id')\\n\\texpiration_date = data.get('expiration_date')\\n\\turl_data[shortened_url] = UrlData(id=len(url_data), original_url=original_url, shortened_url=shortened_url, user_id=user_id, clicks=0, expiration_date=expiration_date, geographical_location=None)\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'URL shortened successfully', 'shortened_url': shortened_url}), 200\\n\\n@app.route('/<shortened_url>', methods=['GET'])\\ndef redirect_to_url(shortened_url):\\n\\turl = url_data.get(shortened_url)\\n\\tif not url or (url.expiration_date and datetime.datetime.now() > datetime.datetime.strptime(url.expiration_date, '%Y-%m-%d')):\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'URL not found or expired'}), 404\\n\\turl.clicks += 1\\n\\treturn redirect(url.original_url, code=302)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"admin.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\\nfrom models import User, UrlData\\nfrom auth import users\\nfrom url_shortener import url_data\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n@app.route('/admin', methods=['GET'])\\ndef admin_dashboard():\\n\\treturn jsonify({'users': [user.__dict__ for user in users.values()], 'urls': [url.__dict__ for url in url_data.values()]}), 200\\n\\n@app.route('/admin/delete_user', methods=['DELETE'])\\ndef delete_user():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tusername = data['username']\\n\\tif username not in users:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'User not found'}), 404\\n\\tdel users[username]\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'User deleted successfully'}), 200\\n\\n@app.route('/admin/delete_url', methods=['DELETE'])\\ndef delete_url():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tshortened_url = data['shortened_url']\\n\\tif shortened_url not in url_data:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'URL not found'}), 404\\n\\tdel url_data[shortened_url]\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'URL deleted successfully'}), 200\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"All tests passed.\"}"}]}
