Users can input a URL to be shortened.\n   - [ ] 1.2. The system validates that the URL is active and legitimate.\n   - [ ] 1.3. The system generates a unique shortened URL.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Users can choose custom short links (subject to availability).\n\n2. **Redirection**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Accessing the shortened URL redirects to the original URL.\n\n3. **Analytics**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 3.2. View number of clicks.\n   - [ ] 3.3. View date/time of each click.\n   - [ ] 3.4. View geographical location of the clicker.\n\n4. **User Accounts**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can create accounts.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Account holders can view all their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Account holders can edit or delete their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.4. Account holders can view analytics for all their shortened URLs.\n\n5. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Administrators can view all shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Administrators can delete any URL or user account.\n   - [ ] 5.3. Administrators can monitor system performance and analytics.\n\n6. **Expiration**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Users can set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL.\n```\n\nThe generated code currently implements the URL shortening, redirection, and basic analytics features. However, it does not implement the user accounts, custom short links, admin dashboard, and URL expiration features. The failure to implement these features may be due to the complexity of these features and the need for additional time and resources to implement them.\n\nTo mitigate this, a new plan could involve breaking down these features into smaller, manageable tasks and implementing them one at a time. For example, the user accounts feature could be broken down into tasks such as creating a user registration form, implementing user authentication, and creating a user dashboard. The custom short links feature could involve adding an optional field for users to input their desired short link and checking for its availability. The admin dashboard could involve creating a separate view for administrators with additional functionalities. The URL expiration feature could involve adding an expiration date to the URL data and checking this date before redirecting to the original URL. \n\nBy breaking down these features into smaller tasks, it would be easier to manage the implementation process and ensure that all features are implemented correctly.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "\n{\n
