application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'models' directory to hold the data models for the application. The models will include User, Transaction (for income and expenses), Budget, Investment, and Alert. Each model will be a Python class with attributes and methods relevant to its function. For example, the User class will have attributes like username, password, email, etc. and methods for creating, updating, and deleting a user. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that each model can be created, updated, and deleted successfully.", "Step 2: Implement the account creation and management feature. This involves creating routes in the Flask application for registering a new user, logging in, and managing user details. The registration route should take a username, password, and email, create a new User object, and store it in the in-memory database. The login route should take a username and password, verify them against the stored User objects, and return a success message if the credentials are correct. The user management route should allow a logged-in user to update their details. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that a user can be registered, logged in, and manage their details successfully.", "Step 3: Implement the secure linking of bank accounts. This feature requires creating a BankAccount model with attributes like bank name, account number, and balance. The User model should be updated to have a list of BankAccount objects. Create routes for adding, updating, and deleting a bank account. The routes should verify the user's credentials before allowing them to perform any actions. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that a bank account can be added, updated, and deleted successfully.", "Step 4: Implement the multi-factor authentication feature. This involves updating the login route to send a verification code to the user's email after they enter their username and password. The user must then enter this code to complete the login process. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the multi-factor authentication process works correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the manual and automatic import of expenses and incomes. This involves creating a Transaction model with attributes like amount, date, and category. The User model should be updated to have a list of Transaction objects. Create routes for adding, updating, and deleting a transaction. The routes should verify the user's credentials before allowing them to perform any actions. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that a transaction can be added, updated, and deleted successfully.", "Step 6: Implement the categorization of expenses and income sources. This involves adding a 'category' attribute to the Transaction model and creating a route for updating this attribute. The route should verify the user's credentials before allowing them to perform any actions. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that a transaction's category can be updated successfully.", "Step 7: Implement the visualization of expense and income history. This involves creating a route that returns a list of all transactions for a user, sorted by date. The route should verify the user's credentials before allowing them to perform any actions. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the transaction history can be retrieved successfully.", "Step 8: Implement the setting and adjusting of monthly budget goals. This involves creating a Budget model with attributes like amount and month. The User model should be updated to have a list of Budget objects. Create routes for adding, updating, and deleting a budget. The routes should verify the user's credentials before allowing them to perform any actions. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that a budget can be added, updated, and deleted successfully.", "Step 9: Implement the alerts for nearing budget limits. This involves creating an Alert model with attributes like message and date. The User model should be updated to have a list of Alert objects. Create a route for retrieving all alerts for a user. The route should verify the user's credentials before allowing them to perform any actions. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that alerts can be retrieved successfully.", "Step 10: Implement the integration with investment accounts, tracking investment performance and balance, and overview of asset allocation. This involves creating an Investment model with attributes like account name, balance, and asset allocation. The User model should be updated to have a list of Investment objects. Create routes for adding, updating, and deleting an investment. The routes should verify the user's credentials before allowing them to perform any actions. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that an investment can be added, updated, and deleted successfully."], "step": "Step 5: Implement the manual and automatic import of expenses and incomes.
