After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that each model file is created successfully.", "Step 2: Implement the User model. This model should include fields for the user's name, email, password, and a list of linked bank accounts. The password should be hashed for security. Also, implement methods for creating a new user, authenticating a user, and linking a bank account. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover creating a new user, authenticating a user, and linking a bank account.", "Step 3: Implement the Transaction model. This model should include fields for the transaction amount, category, date, and associated user.

After implementing the Investment model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover creating a new investment, getting a user's investments, and tracking investment performance.", "Step 6: Implement the Alert model. This model should include fields for the alert message, type, and associated user. Also, implement methods for creating a new alert, getting a user's alerts, and customizing alerts. After implementing the Alert model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover creating a new alert, getting a user's alerts, and customizing alerts.", "Step 7: Implement the routes for the application. This includes routes for creating a new user, authenticating a user, linking a bank account, creating a new transaction, getting a user's transactions, categorizing transactions, creating a new budget, getting a user's budgets, adjusting a budget, creating a new investment, getting a user's investments, tracking investment performance, creating a new alert, getting a user's alerts, and customizing alerts. After implementing the routes, write tests to ensure that the routes work as expected. The tests should cover all the routes and their associated functionality.", "Step 8: Implement the logic for generating financial reports. This includes calculating monthly summaries of income and expenses, analyzing spending patterns, and providing an overview of asset allocation. After implementing the report generation logic, write tests to ensure that the reports are generated correctly. The tests should cover the calculation of monthly summaries, the analysis of spending patterns, and the overview of asset allocation.", "Step 9: Implement the logic for multi-factor authentication. This includes sending a verification code to the user's email when they try to log in, and checking the code when they enter it. After implementing the multi-factor authentication logic, write tests to ensure that the authentication works as expected. The tests should cover sending the verification code and checking the code.", "Step 10: Finally, implement the logic for sending alerts. This includes sending alerts when a user is nearing their budget limit, when there is unusual spending, and when there are important reminders. After implementing the alert sending logic, write tests to ensure that the alerts are sent correctly. The tests should cover sending alerts for nearing budget limits, unusual spending, and important reminders."], "step": "Step 2: Implement the User model.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
