This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'models' directory to hold the data models for the application. The models will include User, Transaction (for income and expenses), Budget, Investment, and Alert. Each model will have its own file in the 'models' directory. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that each model file is created successfully.", "Step 2: Implement the User model. This model should include fields for the user's name, email, password, and a list of linked bank accounts. The password should be hashed for security. Also, implement methods for creating a new user, authenticating a user, and linking a bank account. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover creating a new user, authenticating a user, and linking a bank account.", "Step 3: Implement the Transaction model. This model should include fields for the transaction amount, category, date, and associated user. Also, implement methods for creating a new transaction, getting a user's transactions, and categorizing transactions. After implementing the Transaction model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover creating a new transaction, getting a user's transactions, and categorizing transactions.", "Step 4: Implement the Budget model. This model should include fields for the budget amount, category, and associated user. Also, implement methods for creating a new budget, getting a user's budgets, and adjusting a budget. After implementing the Budget model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover creating a new budget, getting a user's budgets, and adjusting a budget.", "Step 5: Implement the Investment model. This model should include fields for the investment amount, type, and associated user. Also, implement methods for creating a new investment, getting a user's investments, and tracking investment performance. After implementing the Investment model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover creating a new investment, getting a user's investments, and tracking investment performance.", "Step 6: Implement the Alert model. This model should include fields for the alert message, type, and associated user. Also, implement methods for creating a new alert, getting a user's alerts, and customizing alerts. After implementing the Alert model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover creating a new alert, getting a user's alerts, and customizing alerts.", "Step 7: Implement the routes for the application. This includes routes for creating a new user, authenticating a user, linking a bank account, creating a new transaction, getting a user's transactions, categorizing transactions, creating a new budget, getting a user's budgets, adjusting a budget, creating a new investment, getting a user's investments, tracking investment performance, creating a new alert, getting a user's alerts, and customizing alerts. After implementing the routes, write tests to ensure that the routes work as expected. The tests should cover all the routes and their associated functionality.", "Step 8: Implement the logic for generating financial reports. This includes calculating monthly summaries of income and expenses, analyzing spending patterns, and providing an overview of asset allocation. After implementing the report generation logic, write tests to ensure that the reports are generated correctly. The tests should cover the calculation of monthly summaries, the analysis of spending patterns, and the overview of asset allocation.", "Step 9: Implement the logic for multi-factor authentication. This includes sending a verification code to the user's email when they try to log in, and checking the code when they enter it. After implementing the multi-factor authentication logic, write tests to ensure that the authentication works as expected. The tests should cover sending the verification code and checking the code.", "Step 10: Finally, implement the logic for sending alerts. This includes sending alerts when a user is nearing their budget limit, when there is unusual spending, and when there are important reminders. After implementing the alert sending logic, write tests to ensure that the alerts are sent correctly. The tests should cover sending alerts for nearing budget limits, unusual spending, and important reminders."], "step": "Step 7: Implement the routes for the application.
