This includes the main application file (app.py), a file for each of the main functionalities (account.py, expense_income.py, budget.py, investment.py, reports.py), and a file for the mock database (database.py). Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary packages. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that all the files exist and can be imported correctly.", "Step 2: Implement the Account and Security functionality. This includes creating a User class in the account.py file with methods for creating and managing a user account. For secure linking of bank accounts, create a method that simulates this process. Implement multi-factor authentication by creating a method that requires additional verification. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a user can be created, a bank account can be linked securely, and multi-factor authentication works as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the Expense and Income Tracking functionality. In the expense_income.py file, create classes for Expense and Income with methods for manual and automatic import of expenses and incomes. Implement categorization of expenses and income sources by adding a category attribute to the Expense and Income classes. For visualization of expense and income history, create a method that returns a summary of expenses and incomes. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that expenses and incomes can be imported, categorized, and visualized correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the Budget Management functionality. In the budget.py file, create a Budget class with methods for setting and adjusting monthly budget goals. Implement alerts for nearing budget limits by creating a method that checks if the budget limit is nearing and returns a warning. For analysis of spending patterns to suggest budget adjustments, create a method that analyzes expenses and suggests adjustments. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that budget goals can be set and adjusted, alerts are triggered when nearing budget limits, and spending patterns can be analyzed correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the Investment Overview functionality. In the investment.py file, create an Investment class with methods for integrating with investment accounts and tracking investment performance and balance. Implement an overview of asset allocation by creating a method that returns a summary of the investments. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that investment accounts can be integrated, investment performance and balance can be tracked, and an overview of asset allocation can be generated correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the Reports and Alerts functionality. In the reports.py file, create methods for generating financial reports and customizable alerts. The financial reports should include monthly summaries of expenses, incomes, budget, and investments. The alerts should be customizable based on user-defined criteria. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that financial reports can be generated and alerts can be customized correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the mock database in the database.py file. The database should be an in-memory dictionary that stores data for users, expenses, incomes, budgets, and investments. Implement methods for adding, updating, and retrieving data from the database. After implementing the mock database, write tests to ensure that data can be added, updated, and retrieved correctly.", "Step 8: Integrate all the functionalities in the main application file (app.py). This includes creating an instance of the User class and using its methods to manage the user account, linking bank accounts, and implementing multi-factor authentication. Use the methods from the Expense, Income, Budget, and Investment classes to implement the respective functionalities. Use the methods from the mock database to store and retrieve data. After integrating all the functionalities, write tests to ensure that the application works as expected.", "Step 9: Review all the code to ensure that it follows best practices for coding and testing. This includes checking for code readability, efficiency, and modularity. Also, ensure that all the tests pass and cover all the functionalities. If any issues are found, fix them and rerun the tests.", "Step 10: Finally, document the entire application. This includes adding comments to the code to explain complex logic, writing a README file to explain how to use the application, and documenting the tests to explain what they cover. After documenting the application, run a final round of tests to ensure that everything works as expected."], "step": "Step 4: Implement the Budget Management functionality.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
