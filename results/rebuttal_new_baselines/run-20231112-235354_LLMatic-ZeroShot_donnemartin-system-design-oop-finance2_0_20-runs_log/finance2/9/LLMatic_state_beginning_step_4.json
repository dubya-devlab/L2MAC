After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the application runs without errors and that each model file is correctly set up.", "Step 2: Implement the User model. This model will have fields for username, password, email, and a list of linked bank accounts. The password should be hashed for security. Also, implement methods for creating a new user, authenticating a user, and linking a bank account. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that a new user can be created, a user can be authenticated, and a bank account can be linked to a user.", "Step 3: Implement the Transaction model. This model will have fields for the user it belongs to, the amount, the type (income or expense), the category, and the date. Also, implement methods for creating a new transaction, getting a user's transactions, and categorizing a transaction. After implementing the Transaction model, write tests to ensure that a new transaction can be created, a user's transactions can be retrieved, and a transaction can be categorized.", "Step 4: Implement the Budget model. This model will have fields for the user it belongs to, the amount, and the category. Also, implement methods for setting a budget, adjusting a budget, and checking if a budget limit is nearing. After implementing the Budget model, write tests to ensure that a budget can be set, a budget can be adjusted, and a budget limit nearing can be checked.", "Step 5: Implement the Investment model. This model will have fields for the user it belongs to, the type of investment, the amount, and the performance. Also, implement methods for linking an investment account, tracking investment performance, and getting an overview of asset allocation. After implementing the Investment model, write tests to ensure that an investment account can be linked, investment performance can be tracked, and an overview of asset allocation can be gotten.", "Step 6: Implement the Alert model. This model will have fields for the user it belongs to, the type of alert, and the message. Also, implement methods for generating financial reports, setting customizable alerts, and sending alerts. After implementing the Alert model, write tests to ensure that financial reports can be generated, customizable alerts can be set, and alerts can be sent.", "Step 7: Implement the views for the application. This includes views for user registration and login, transaction creation and categorization, budget setting and adjustment, investment account linking and tracking, and alert setting and sending. After implementing the views, write tests to ensure that each view works as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the templates for the application. This includes templates for the registration and login pages, the transaction page, the budget page, the investment page, and the alert page. After implementing the templates, write tests to ensure that each template renders correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the static files for the application. This includes CSS files for styling the application and JavaScript files for adding interactivity to the application. After implementing the static files, write tests to ensure that each static file is correctly linked and works as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, implement the main application logic in app.py. This includes setting up the routes for the application, initializing the models, and running the application. After implementing the main application logic, write tests to ensure that the application runs without errors, the routes work as expected, and the models are correctly initialized."], "step": "Step 5: Implement the Investment model.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
