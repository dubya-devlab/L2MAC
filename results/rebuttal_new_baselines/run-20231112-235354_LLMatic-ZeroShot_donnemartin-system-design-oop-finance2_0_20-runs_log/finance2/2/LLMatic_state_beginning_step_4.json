This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up the Flask application. Also, create a 'models' directory to hold the data models for the application. The models will include User, Transaction (for income and expenses), Budget, Investment, and Alert. Each model will have its own file in the 'models' directory. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the application runs without errors and that each model file is correctly set up.", "Step 2: Implement the User model. This model should include fields for the user's name, email, password, and a list of linked bank accounts. The password should be hashed for security. Also, implement methods for creating a new user, authenticating a user, and linking a bank account. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover user creation, authentication, and bank account linking.", "Step 3: Implement the Transaction model. This model should include fields for the transaction amount, type (income or expense), category, and date. Also, implement methods for creating a new transaction, retrieving a user's transactions, and categorizing transactions. After implementing the Transaction model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover transaction creation, retrieval, and categorization.", "Step 4: Implement the Budget model. This model should include fields for the budget amount, category, and month. Also, implement methods for setting a budget, adjusting a budget, and checking if a budget limit is nearing. After implementing the Budget model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover budget setting, adjustment, and limit checking.", "Step 5: Implement the Investment model. This model should include fields for the investment account name, balance, and asset allocation. Also, implement methods for linking an investment account, tracking investment performance, and viewing asset allocation. After implementing the Investment model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover investment account linking, performance tracking, and asset allocation viewing.", "Step 6: Implement the Alert model. This model should include fields for the alert type (e.g., unusual spending or important reminder), message, and date. Also, implement methods for creating an alert and retrieving a user's alerts. After implementing the Alert model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover alert creation and retrieval.", "Step 7: Implement the views for the application. This includes views for user registration and login, transaction management, budget management, investment overview, and alerts. Each view should have its own file in a 'views' directory. After implementing the views, write tests to ensure that the views work as expected. The tests should cover all the functionalities provided by the views.", "Step 8: Implement the controllers for the application. This includes controllers for user management, transaction management, budget management, investment management, and alerts. Each controller should have its own file in a 'controllers' directory. After implementing the controllers, write tests to ensure that the controllers work as expected. The tests should cover all the functionalities provided by the controllers.", "Step 9: Implement the routes for the application. This includes routes for user registration and login, transaction management, budget management, investment overview, and alerts. The routes should be defined in the main application file (app.py). After implementing the routes, write tests to ensure that the routes work as expected. The tests should cover all the functionalities provided by the routes.", "Step 10: Finally, implement the multi-factor authentication feature. This can be done by integrating with a third-party service like Google Authenticator. After implementing multi-factor authentication, write tests to ensure that the feature works as expected. The tests should cover the process of setting up multi-factor authentication and authenticating a user with it."], "step": "Step 5: Implement the Investment model.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
