The models will include User, Transaction (for income and expenses), Budget, Investment, and Alert. Each model will have its own file in the 'models' directory. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the application runs without errors and that each model can be created and manipulated as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the account creation and management functionality. This includes creating a registration form, a login form, and routes for registration and login in the main application file. The User model should include fields for username, password, and email. Implement password hashing for security. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can register, log in, and that their passwords are stored securely.", "Step 3: Implement the functionality for linking bank accounts. This will involve creating a form for users to input their bank account details, and a method in the User model to store these details. For the purpose of this task, the bank account details will be stored in memory and not actually linked to a real bank account. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can input their bank account details and that these details are stored correctly.", "Step 4: Implement multi-factor authentication. This will involve sending a verification code to the user's email when they register or log in, and asking them to input this code to verify their identity. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that the verification code is sent and that users can input it to verify their identity.", "Step 5: Implement the functionality for importing and categorizing expenses and incomes. This will involve creating a form for users to input their transactions, and methods in the Transaction model to store and categorize these transactions. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can input their transactions and that these transactions are stored and categorized correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the functionality for visualizing expense and income history. This will involve creating a method in the User model to retrieve a user's transactions, and a route in the main application file to display these transactions. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can view their transaction history and that the history is displayed correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the functionality for setting and adjusting monthly budget goals. This will involve creating a form for users to input their budget goals, and methods in the Budget model to store these goals. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can set and adjust their budget goals and that these goals are stored correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the functionality for alerts for nearing budget limits. This will involve creating a method in the Budget model to check if a user is nearing their budget limit, and a method in the Alert model to create an alert if this is the case. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that alerts are created when a user is nearing their budget limit.", "Step 9: Implement the functionality for integrating with investment accounts and tracking investment performance. This will involve creating a form for users to input their investment account details, and methods in the Investment model to store these details and track investment performance. For the purpose of this task, the investment account details will be stored in memory and not actually linked to a real investment account. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can input their investment account details, that these details are stored correctly, and that investment performance is tracked correctly.", "Step 10: Implement the functionality for generating financial reports and customizable alerts. This will involve creating a method in the User model to generate a financial report, and methods in the Alert model to create and customize alerts. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that financial reports can be generated and that alerts can be created and customized."], "step": "Step 3: Implement the functionality for linking bank accounts.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
