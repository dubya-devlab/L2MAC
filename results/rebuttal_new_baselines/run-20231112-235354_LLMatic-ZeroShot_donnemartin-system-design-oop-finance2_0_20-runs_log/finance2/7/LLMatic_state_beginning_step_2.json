This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up the Flask framework. The app.py file will serve as the entry point for the application. It will import and use the other modules that we will create in the following steps. Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the Python packages that will be used in the project. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the application runs without errors and the requirements.txt file includes all necessary packages.", "Step 2: Implement the Account and Security features. This includes creating a User class with methods for creating and managing a user account. The User class should be defined in a separate module (user.py). It should have attributes for storing user information and methods for creating a new user, updating user information, and deleting a user. Also, implement functions for secure linking of bank accounts and multi-factor authentication. These functions should be defined in a separate module (security.py). After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the User class and the security functions work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the Expense and Income Tracking features. This includes creating classes for Expenses and Incomes, with methods for manual and automatic import of expenses and incomes. The Expenses and Incomes classes should be defined in separate modules (expenses.py and incomes.py). They should have attributes for storing expense and income information and methods for adding, updating, and deleting expenses and incomes. Also, implement a function for categorizing expenses and income sources. This function should be defined in a separate module (categorization.py). After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the Expenses and Incomes classes and the categorization function work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the Visualization of expense and income history feature. This includes creating a function for generating visualizations of expense and income history. The function should be defined in a separate module (visualization.py). It should take as input the expenses and incomes of a user and return a visualization of the expense and income history. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the visualization function works as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the Budget Management features. This includes creating a Budget class with methods for setting and adjusting monthly budget goals and generating alerts for nearing budget limits. The Budget class should be defined in a separate module (budget.py). It should have attributes for storing budget information and methods for setting and adjusting budget goals, and generating alerts. Also, implement a function for analyzing spending patterns to suggest budget adjustments. This function should be defined in a separate module (analysis.py). After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the Budget class and the analysis function work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the Investment Overview features. This includes creating an Investment class with methods for integrating with investment accounts, tracking investment performance and balance, and providing an overview of asset allocation. The Investment class should be defined in a separate module (investment.py). It should have attributes for storing investment information and methods for integrating with investment accounts, tracking investment performance and balance, and providing an overview of asset allocation. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the Investment class works as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the Reports and Alerts features. This includes creating a Reports class with methods for generating financial reports (e.g., monthly summaries) and customizable alerts for unusual spending or important reminders. The Reports class should be defined in a separate module (reports.py). It should have attributes for storing report information and methods for generating reports and alerts. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the Reports class works as expected.", "Step 8: Integrate all the features implemented in the previous steps. This includes updating the main application file (app.py) to import and use the User, Expenses, Incomes, Budget, Investment, and Reports classes, and the security, categorization, visualization, and analysis functions. Also, implement the main application logic in the app.py file. This includes setting up the Flask routes and views for handling user requests and responses. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application works as expected.", "Step 9: Perform a final review of the application. This includes checking the code for errors and inconsistencies, ensuring that all features have been implemented correctly, and that the application meets the functional requirements. Also, run all the tests written in the previous steps to ensure that they all pass.", "Step 10: Prepare the application for deployment. This includes creating a setup.py file for packaging the application, updating the requirements.txt file with any additional packages needed for deployment, and writing a README.md file with instructions for installing and running the application. After preparing the application for deployment, write tests to ensure that the application can be installed and run without errors."], "step": "Step 3: Implement the Expense and Income Tracking features.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
