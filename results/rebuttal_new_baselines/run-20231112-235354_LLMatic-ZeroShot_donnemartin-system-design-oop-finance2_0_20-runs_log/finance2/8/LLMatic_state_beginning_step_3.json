The models will include User, Transaction (for income and expenses), Budget, Investment, and Alert. Each model will have its own file in the 'models' directory. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the application runs without errors and that each model file is correctly set up.", "Step 2: Implement the User model. This model should include fields for the user's name, email, password, and a list of linked bank accounts. The password should be hashed for security. Also, implement methods for creating a new user, authenticating a user, and linking a bank account. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover user creation, authentication, and bank account linking.", "Step 3: Implement the Transaction model. This model should include fields for the amount, date, category, and the user who made the transaction. Also, implement methods for creating a new transaction, getting a user's transactions, and categorizing transactions. After implementing the Transaction model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover transaction creation, retrieval, and categorization.", "Step 4: Implement the Budget model. This model should include fields for the amount, category, and the user who set the budget. Also, implement methods for setting a new budget, adjusting a budget, and getting a user's budgets. After implementing the Budget model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover budget setting, adjustment, and retrieval.", "Step 5: Implement the Investment model. This model should include fields for the type of investment, amount, date, and the user who made the investment. Also, implement methods for creating a new investment, getting a user's investments, and tracking investment performance. After implementing the Investment model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover investment creation, retrieval, and performance tracking.", "Step 6: Implement the Alert model. This model should include fields for the type of alert, message, date, and the user who will receive the alert. Also, implement methods for creating a new alert, getting a user's alerts, and customizing alerts. After implementing the Alert model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover alert creation, retrieval, and customization.", "Step 7: Implement the views for the application. This includes views for user registration and login, transaction management, budget management, investment management, and alert management. Each view should have its own file in a 'views' directory. After implementing the views, write tests to ensure that each view works as expected. The tests should cover all the functionality provided by each view.", "Step 8: Implement the controllers for the application. This includes controllers for user management, transaction management, budget management, investment management, and alert management. Each controller should have its own file in a 'controllers' directory. After implementing the controllers, write tests to ensure that each controller works as expected. The tests should cover all the functionality provided by each controller.", "Step 9: Implement the routes for the application. This includes routes for user registration and login, transaction management, budget management, investment management, and alert management. The routes should be defined in the main application file (app.py). After implementing the routes, write tests to ensure that each route works as expected. The tests should cover all the functionality provided by each route.", "Step 10: Finally, implement the front-end of the application. This includes creating HTML templates for each view and using CSS and JavaScript to style and add interactivity to the templates. After implementing the front-end, write tests to ensure that the front-end works as expected. The tests should cover all the functionality provided by the front-end."], "step": "Step 4: Implement the Budget model.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
