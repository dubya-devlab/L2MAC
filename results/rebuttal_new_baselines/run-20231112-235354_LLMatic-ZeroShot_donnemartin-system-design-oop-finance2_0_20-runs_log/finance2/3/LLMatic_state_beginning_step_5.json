This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'models' directory to hold the data models for the application. The models will include User, Transaction (for income and expenses), Budget, Investment, and Alert. Each model will have its own file in the 'models' directory. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that each model file is created successfully.", "Step 2: Implement the User model. This model should include fields for the user's name, email, password, and a list of linked bank accounts. The password should be hashed for security. Also, implement methods for creating a new user, authenticating a user, and linking a bank account. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover creating a new user, authenticating a user, and linking a bank account.", "Step 3: Implement the Transaction model. This model should include fields for the transaction amount, category, date, and associated user. Also, implement methods for creating a new transaction, getting a user's transactions, and categorizing transactions. After implementing the Transaction model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover creating a new transaction, getting a user's transactions, and categorizing transactions.", "Step 4: Implement the Budget model. This model should include fields for the budget amount, category, and associated user. Also, implement methods for setting a budget, adjusting a budget, and getting a user's budgets. After implementing the Budget model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover setting a budget, adjusting a budget, and getting a user's budgets.", "Step 5: Implement the Investment model. This model should include fields for the investment amount, type, and associated user. Also, implement methods for linking an investment account, tracking investment performance, and getting a user's investments. After implementing the Investment model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover linking an investment account, tracking investment performance, and getting a user's investments.", "Step 6: Implement the Alert model. This model should include fields for the alert type, message, and associated user. Also, implement methods for creating an alert, getting a user's alerts, and customizing alerts. After implementing the Alert model, write tests to ensure that the model works as expected. The tests should cover creating an alert, getting a user's alerts, and customizing alerts.", "Step 7: Implement the routes for the application. This includes routes for creating a user, authenticating a user, linking a bank account, creating a transaction, getting transactions, setting a budget, adjusting a budget, getting budgets, linking an investment account, tracking investment performance, getting investments, creating an alert, getting alerts, and customizing alerts. After implementing the routes, write tests to ensure that each route works as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the views for the application. This includes views for the user dashboard, transaction history, budget overview, investment overview, and alerts. Each view should display the relevant data for the logged-in user. After implementing the views, write tests to ensure that each view displays the correct data.", "Step 9: Implement the controllers for the application. This includes controllers for handling user actions such as creating a transaction, setting a budget, linking an investment account, and customizing alerts. Each controller should interact with the relevant model to perform the desired action. After implementing the controllers, write tests to ensure that each controller performs the desired action correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, implement the multi-factor authentication feature. This feature should require the user to provide a second form of identification (such as a code sent to their email) when logging in. After implementing multi-factor authentication, write tests to ensure that the feature works as expected."], "step": "Step 6: Implement the Alert model.
