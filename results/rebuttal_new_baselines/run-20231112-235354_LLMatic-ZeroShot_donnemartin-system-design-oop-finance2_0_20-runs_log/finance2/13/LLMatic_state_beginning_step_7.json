This includes the main application file (app.py), a file for each major feature (account.py, expense_income.py, budget.py, investment.py, reports.py), and a file for tests (test_app.py). Each file should have a corresponding test file (test_account.py, test_expense_income.py, test_budget.py, test_investment.py, test_reports.py). Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary packages. After setting up the project structure, write a basic Flask application in app.py and run it to ensure everything is set up correctly. Then, write tests in test_app.py to confirm that the Flask application runs as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the account management feature. In account.py, define a User class with attributes for username, password, and linked bank accounts. Also, implement methods for creating a new user, authenticating a user, and linking a bank account. For now, mock the bank account linking process by simply storing the bank account number in the User object. Also, implement a basic form of multi-factor authentication by requiring the user to enter a code sent to their email when logging in. After implementing these features, write tests in test_account.py to ensure they work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the expense and income tracking feature. In expense_income.py, define an Expense class and an Income class, each with attributes for amount, category, and date. Also, implement methods for adding a new expense or income, categorizing an expense or income, and viewing the history of expenses and incomes. After implementing these features, write tests in test_expense_income.py to ensure they work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the budget management feature. In budget.py, define a Budget class with attributes for monthly budget goals and current spending. Also, implement methods for setting and adjusting budget goals, alerting the user when they are nearing their budget limit, and analyzing spending patterns to suggest budget adjustments. After implementing these features, write tests in test_budget.py to ensure they work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the investment overview feature. In investment.py, define an Investment class with attributes for investment accounts, performance, and balance. Also, implement methods for linking an investment account, tracking investment performance and balance, and providing an overview of asset allocation. After implementing these features, write tests in test_investment.py to ensure they work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the reports and alerts feature. In reports.py, implement methods for generating financial reports and setting up customizable alerts. The financial reports should include monthly summaries of expenses, incomes, budget, and investments. The alerts should notify the user of unusual spending or important reminders. After implementing these features, write tests in test_reports.py to ensure they work as expected.", "Step 7: Integrate all the features in the main application file (app.py). This includes setting up routes for each feature and handling user input and output. Also, ensure that the application handles errors gracefully and provides informative error messages to the user. After integrating all the features, write tests in test_app.py to ensure the application works as a whole.", "Step 8: Review the entire application and make any necessary improvements. This includes refactoring the code to make it more efficient and readable, adding comments to explain complex bits of logic, and ensuring that the application follows best practices for Flask applications. After making improvements, rerun all the tests to ensure that they still pass.", "Step 9: Perform a final review of the application. This includes checking that all the functional requirements have been implemented, that the application handles all possible edge cases, and that the application provides a good user experience. Also, ensure that the application is ready for deployment, which includes checking that all necessary packages are listed in requirements.txt and that the application can be run in a production environment. After performing the final review, rerun all the tests one last time to ensure that they still pass.", "Step 10: Prepare the application for deployment.
