"requirements.txt": ["Flask", "pytest", "dataclasses"]}, "steps": ["Step 1: Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. This includes the main application file (app.py), a file for each major feature (account.py, expense_income.py, budget.py, investment.py, reports_alerts.py), and a file for tests (test_app.py). Each feature file should contain a class that handles the functionality for that feature. For example, the Account class in account.py should handle user account creation and management, bank account linking, and multi-factor authentication. After setting up the project structure, write a basic Flask application in app.py that imports and uses these classes. Also, create a requirements.txt file that lists the necessary Python packages (Flask, pytest, dataclasses). Finally, write a test in test_app.py that checks if the Flask application runs correctly.", "Step 2: Implement the Account class in account.py. This class should have methods for creating a user account (create_account), linking a bank account (link_bank_account), and handling multi-factor authentication (handle_mfa). The user account information and linked bank accounts can be stored in dictionaries for now. After implementing the Account class, write tests in test_app.py that check if these methods work correctly. These tests should create a user account, link a bank account, and handle multi-factor authentication, and then check if the account information and linked bank accounts are stored correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the ExpenseIncome class in expense_income.py. This class should have methods for importing expenses and incomes (import_expenses_incomes), categorizing them (categorize_expenses_incomes), and visualizing the expense and income history (visualize_expense_income_history). The expenses and incomes can be stored in dictionaries for now. After implementing the ExpenseIncome class, write tests in test_app.py that check if these methods work correctly. These tests should import expenses and incomes, categorize them, and visualize the expense and income history, and then check if the expenses and incomes are stored and categorized correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the Budget class in budget.py. This class should have methods for setting and adjusting monthly budget goals (set_adjust_budget), alerting for nearing budget limits (alert_budget_limit), and analyzing spending patterns to suggest budget adjustments (analyze_spending). The budget goals and spending patterns can be stored in dictionaries for now. After implementing the Budget class, write tests in test_app.py that check if these methods work correctly. These tests should set and adjust monthly budget goals, alert for nearing budget limits, and analyze spending patterns to suggest budget adjustments, and then check if the budget goals and spending patterns are stored and analyzed correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the Investment class in investment.py. This class should have methods for integrating with investment accounts (integrate_investment_account), tracking investment performance and balance (track_investment), and providing an overview of asset allocation (overview_asset_allocation). The investment accounts and asset allocation can be stored in dictionaries for now. After implementing the Investment class, write tests in test_app.py that check if these methods work correctly. These tests should integrate with investment accounts, track investment performance and balance, and provide an overview of asset allocation, and then check if the investment accounts and asset allocation are stored and tracked correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the ReportsAlerts class in reports_alerts.py. This class should have methods for generating financial reports (generate_report) and customizable alerts for unusual spending or important reminders (custom_alert). The reports and alerts can be stored in dictionaries for now. After implementing the ReportsAlerts class, write tests in test_app.py that check if these methods work correctly. These tests should generate financial reports and customizable alerts, and then check if the reports and alerts are stored correctly.", "Step 7: Integrate the classes in app.py. The Flask application should use the methods from the Account, ExpenseIncome, Budget, Investment, and ReportsAlerts classes to provide the functionality for the personal finance tracking application. After integrating the classes, write tests in test_app.py that check if the Flask application works correctly. These tests should use the Flask application to create a user account, link a bank account, handle multi-factor authentication, import expenses and incomes, categorize them, visualize the expense and income history, set and adjust monthly budget goals, alert for nearing budget limits, analyze spending patterns to suggest budget adjustments, integrate with investment accounts, track investment performance and balance, provide an overview of asset allocation, generate financial reports, and create customizable alerts, and then check if these actions are performed correctly.", "Step 8: Refactor the code and improve the tests. Review the code in app.py, account.py, expense_income.py, budget.py, investment.py, and reports_alerts.py, and refactor it to improve readability, efficiency, and maintainability. Also, improve the tests in test_app.py to cover more edge cases and improve code coverage. After refactoring the code and improving the tests, run the tests again to make sure they all pass.", "Step 9: Document the code. Add comments to the code in app.py, account.py, expense_income.py, budget.py, investment.py, and reports_alerts.py to explain what each part of the code does. Also, write a README.md file that explains how to use the personal finance tracking application, including how to run the application and the tests.", "Step 10: Package the project. Create a setup.py file that specifies the project metadata and dependencies, so that the personal finance tracking application can be easily installed and used by others. After packaging the project, test the installation process to make sure it works correctly."], "step": "Step 8: Refactor the code and improve the tests.
