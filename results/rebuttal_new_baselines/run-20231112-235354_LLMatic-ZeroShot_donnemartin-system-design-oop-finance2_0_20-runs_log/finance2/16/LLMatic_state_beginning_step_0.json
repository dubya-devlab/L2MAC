This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up the Flask framework. The app.py file will contain the main routes for the application, such as the home page, login page, and registration page. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data, transaction data, and budget data. At this stage, the focus is on setting up the basic structure, so the routes can return simple messages to confirm they are working correctly. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to confirm that the application runs and the routes return the expected responses.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and login functionality. This involves creating a User class with attributes such as username, password, and email. The User class should also have methods for creating a new user and authenticating a user. The registration route should use the User class to create a new user and store it in the mock database. The login route should authenticate the user and create a session. After implementing the user registration and login functionality, write tests to confirm that a user can register, login, and that the session is correctly created.", "Step 3: Implement the functionality for linking bank accounts. This involves creating a BankAccount class with attributes such as bank name, account number, and balance. The BankAccount class should also have methods for adding a new bank account and updating the balance. The user should be able to add a bank account through a route in the application. After implementing the bank account linking functionality, write tests to confirm that a user can add a bank account and that the balance is correctly updated.", "Step 4: Implement the functionality for tracking expenses and incomes. This involves creating a Transaction class with attributes such as amount, category, and date. The Transaction class should also have methods for adding a new transaction and getting a list of transactions. The user should be able to add a transaction through a route in the application. After implementing the expense and income tracking functionality, write tests to confirm that a user can add a transaction and that the list of transactions is correctly returned.", "Step 5: Implement the functionality for categorizing expenses and income sources. This involves adding a category attribute to the Transaction class and creating a Category class with attributes such as name and type (income or expense). The user should be able to assign a category to a transaction when adding it. After implementing the categorization functionality, write tests to confirm that a user can assign a category to a transaction and that the category is correctly stored.", "Step 6: Implement the functionality for visualizing expense and income history. This involves creating a route that returns a list of transactions for a given period. The list should be sorted by date and include the category and amount of each transaction. After implementing the visualization functionality, write tests to confirm that the list of transactions is correctly returned and sorted.", "Step 7: Implement the functionality for setting and adjusting monthly budget goals. This involves creating a Budget class with attributes such as amount and month. The Budget class should also have methods for setting a budget and adjusting it. The user should be able to set and adjust their budget through a route in the application. After implementing the budget management functionality, write tests to confirm that a user can set and adjust their budget and that the budget is correctly stored.", "Step 8: Implement the functionality for generating alerts for nearing budget limits. This involves creating a method in the Budget class that checks if the total expenses for the current month are nearing the budget limit. If the expenses are nearing the limit, the method should return an alert message. After implementing the budget alert functionality, write tests to confirm that the alert is correctly generated when the expenses are nearing the budget limit.", "Step 9: Implement the functionality for integrating with investment accounts. This involves creating an InvestmentAccount class with attributes such as account number, balance, and asset allocation. The InvestmentAccount class should also have methods for adding a new investment account and updating the balance and asset allocation. The user should be able to add an investment account through a route in the application. After implementing the investment account integration functionality, write tests to confirm that a user can add an investment account and that the balance and asset allocation are correctly updated.", "Step 10: Implement the functionality for generating financial reports. This involves creating a Report class with methods for generating a monthly summary of expenses, incomes, and budget. The user should be able to request a report through a route in the application. After implementing the report generation functionality, write tests to confirm that the report is correctly generated and includes the expected information."], "step": "Step 1: Start by setting up the basic structure of the application.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
