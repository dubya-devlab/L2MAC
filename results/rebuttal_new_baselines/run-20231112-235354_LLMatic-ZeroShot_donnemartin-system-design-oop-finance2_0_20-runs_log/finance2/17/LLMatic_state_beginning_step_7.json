Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary packages. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that all the files exist and can be imported correctly.", "Step 2: Implement the Account and Security functionality. This includes creating a User class in account.py with methods for creating and managing a user account. Also, implement a mock function for linking bank accounts and a function for multi-factor authentication. The User class should have attributes for username, password, linked bank accounts, and authentication status. Write tests to ensure that a user can be created, a bank account can be linked, and multi-factor authentication can be enabled and disabled.", "Step 3: Implement the Expense and Income Tracking functionality. This includes creating an Expense class and an Income class in expense_income.py. Both classes should have methods for manual and automatic import of expenses and incomes, and for categorizing them. Also, implement a function for visualizing expense and income history. Write tests to ensure that expenses and incomes can be imported and categorized correctly, and that the visualization function returns the expected output.", "Step 4: Implement the Budget Management functionality. This includes creating a Budget class in budget.py with methods for setting and adjusting monthly budget goals, and for generating alerts when nearing budget limits. Also, implement a function for analyzing spending patterns to suggest budget adjustments. Write tests to ensure that budget goals can be set and adjusted, alerts are generated correctly, and the spending pattern analysis function returns the expected output.", "Step 5: Implement the Investment Overview functionality. This includes creating an Investment class in investment.py with methods for integrating with investment accounts, tracking investment performance and balance, and providing an overview of asset allocation. Write tests to ensure that investment accounts can be integrated, investment performance and balance can be tracked, and the asset allocation overview function returns the expected output.", "Step 6: Implement the Reports and Alerts functionality. This includes creating a Reports class in reports.py with methods for generating financial reports and customizable alerts. Write tests to ensure that financial reports can be generated and alerts can be customized correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the mock database in database.py. This should be an in-memory dictionary that stores data for users, expenses, incomes, budgets, investments, and reports. Write tests to ensure that data can be added, retrieved, updated, and deleted correctly from the mock database.", "Step 8: Integrate all the functionalities in the main application file (app.py).

Also, create instances of the Expense, Income, Budget, Investment, and Reports classes and use their methods to manage expenses, incomes, budgets, investments, and reports. Write tests to ensure that all the functionalities can be used together correctly.", "Step 9: Implement a user interface for the application. This could be a command-line interface that prompts the user to enter commands for managing their account, expenses, incomes, budgets, investments, and reports. Write tests to ensure that the user interface works correctly and handles user input as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, run all the tests together to ensure that the entire application works as expected.
