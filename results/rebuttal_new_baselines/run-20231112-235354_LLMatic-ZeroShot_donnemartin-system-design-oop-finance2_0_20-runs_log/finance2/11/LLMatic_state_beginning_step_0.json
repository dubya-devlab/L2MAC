Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. This includes the main application file (app.py), a file for each major feature (account.py, expense.py, budget.py, investment.py, report.py), and a file for tests (test_app.py). In each file, define the necessary classes and methods, but leave the implementations empty for now. For example, in account.py, define a User class with methods for creating an account, linking a bank account, and handling authentication. In test_app.py, write stubs for tests corresponding to each feature. After setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files, run pytest to ensure that the test stubs are correctly set up and that the project structure is correct.", "2. Implement the Account and Security feature. In the User class in account.py, write the code for creating a user account, linking a bank account, and handling authentication. This will involve storing user data in an in-memory dictionary to simulate a database. Make sure to handle edge cases, such as attempting to create an account with an existing username, or linking a bank account that is already linked to another user. After implementing this feature, write tests in test_app.py to verify that the account creation, bank account linking, and authentication work correctly. Run these tests using pytest.", "3. Implement the Expense and Income Tracking feature. In expense.py, define a Transaction class with methods for importing expenses and incomes, categorizing them, and visualizing the transaction history. The import method should allow for both manual entry of transactions and automatic import from a linked bank account. The categorization method should assign each transaction to a category based on its description. The visualization method should return a summary of transactions over a given time period. After implementing this feature, write tests in test_app.py to verify that transactions can be correctly imported, categorized, and visualized. Run these tests using pytest.", "4. Implement the Budget Management feature. In budget.py, define a Budget class with methods for setting and adjusting monthly budget goals, sending alerts when nearing budget limits, and analyzing spending patterns to suggest budget adjustments. The budget goals should be stored per category of expense. The alert method should check if the total expenses in any category are nearing the budget limit for that category. The analysis method should compare the actual spending in each category to the budget for that category, and suggest adjustments if necessary. After implementing this feature, write tests in test_app.py to verify that budgets can be correctly set and adjusted, that alerts are sent when nearing budget limits, and that spending patterns are correctly analyzed. Run these tests using pytest.", "5. Implement the Investment Overview feature. In investment.py, define an Investment class with methods for integrating with investment accounts, tracking investment performance and balance, and providing an overview of asset allocation. The integration method should allow for linking an investment account in a similar way to linking a bank account. The tracking method should update the investment balance and performance based on data from the linked investment account. The overview method should return a summary of the asset allocation in the investment account. After implementing this feature, write tests in test_app.py to verify that investment accounts can be correctly linked, that investment performance and balance are correctly tracked, and that the asset allocation overview is correct. Run these tests using pytest.", "6. Implement the Reports and Alerts feature. In report.py, define a Report class with methods for generating financial reports and sending customizable alerts. The report generation method should create a summary of transactions, budgets, and investments over a given time period. The alert method should allow the user to set custom alerts based on specific conditions, such as unusual spending or important reminders. After implementing this feature, write tests in test_app.py to verify that reports can be correctly generated and that custom alerts work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "7. Integrate all the features in the main application file (app.py). This involves creating instances of the User, Transaction, Budget, Investment, and Report classes, and linking them together. For example, the User instance should have a list of Transaction instances representing the user's transaction history, a Budget instance representing the user's budget, and an Investment instance representing the user's investments. The User instance should also be able to generate reports and send alerts using the Report instance. After integrating all the features, write tests in test_app.py to verify that the entire application works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "8. After all features have been implemented and all tests pass, perform a code review to ensure that the code follows best practices. This includes checking for consistent indentation and naming conventions, removing any unused imports or variables, and adding comments to explain complex bits of logic. Also, make sure that the code is organized in a logical way, with related functions and classes grouped together. After performing the code review, run all tests again to ensure that no functionality has been broken.", "9. Create a requirements.txt file listing all the Python packages used in the project. This includes Flask for the web application framework, pytest for testing, and any other packages used for specific features, such as a package for integrating with bank or investment account APIs. After creating the requirements.txt file, test the installation of the packages in a clean Python environment to ensure that all dependencies are correctly specified.", "10. Finally, write a README.md file explaining how to set up and use the application. This should include instructions for installing the required packages, running the application, and using each feature. Also include a section explaining how to run the tests. After writing the README.md file, test the instructions in a clean environment to ensure that they are clear and correct."], "step": "1.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
