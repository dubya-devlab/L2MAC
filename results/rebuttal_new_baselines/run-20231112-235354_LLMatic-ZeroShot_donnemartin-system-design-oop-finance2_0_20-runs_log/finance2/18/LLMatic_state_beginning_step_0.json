This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up the Flask framework. The app.py file will serve as the entry point for the application. It will import and use the other modules that we will create in the following steps. Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and dataclasses. After setting up the basic structure, write a test to ensure that the application runs without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the Account and Security features. Create a User class in a new module (user.py) to represent a user account. The User class should have methods for creating and managing a user account. Also, create a mock database (a dictionary) to store user accounts. The User class should also have methods for linking bank accounts and implementing multi-factor authentication. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the Expense and Income Tracking features. Create an Expense class and an Income class in a new module (finance.py). These classes should have methods for importing expenses and incomes (both manually and automatically), categorizing them, and visualizing their history. Also, update the User class to include a list of expenses and incomes. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the Budget Management features. Add methods to the User class for setting and adjusting monthly budget goals, and for sending alerts when nearing budget limits. Also, create a Budget class in the finance.py module to represent a budget. The Budget class should have methods for analyzing spending patterns and suggesting budget adjustments. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the Investment Overview features. Create an Investment class in a new module (investment.py). The Investment class should have methods for integrating with investment accounts, tracking investment performance and balance, and providing an overview of asset allocation. Also, update the User class to include a list of investments. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the Reports and Alerts features. Add methods to the User class for generating financial reports and customizable alerts. The reports should include monthly summaries of expenses, incomes, and investments. The alerts should notify the user of unusual spending or important reminders. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "Step 7: Integrate all the features in the main application file (app.py). The app.py file should import the User, Expense, Income, Budget, and Investment classes, and use them to provide the functionality of the application. Also, set up the Flask routes to handle the different requests from the user. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application works as a whole.", "Step 8: Refactor the code to improve its quality and maintainability. This includes removing any duplication, simplifying complex parts, and adding comments to explain the purpose of the functions and classes. Also, ensure that the code follows the best practices for Python and Flask. After refactoring the code, run all the tests again to ensure that everything still works as expected.", "Step 9: Perform a final review of the code and the tests. Ensure that all the functional requirements have been implemented, and that all the tests pass. Also, check that the code is well-structured, well-documented, and easy to understand. If any issues are found, fix them and run the tests again.", "Step 10: Package the application for deployment. This includes creating a setup.py file to specify the application's dependencies, and a README.md file to provide instructions on how to install and use the application.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
