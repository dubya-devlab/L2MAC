This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'models' directory to hold the data models for the application. The models will include User, Transaction (for income and expenses), Budget, Investment, and Alert. Each model will have its own file in the 'models' directory. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that each model file is created.", "Step 2: Implement the User model. This model should include fields for the user's name, email, password, and a list of linked bank accounts. The password should be hashed for security. Also, implement methods for creating a new user and authenticating a user. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that a new user can be created and authenticated.", "Step 3: Implement the Transaction model. This model should include fields for the amount, date, category, and whether it is an income or an expense. Also, implement methods for creating a new transaction and retrieving a user's transactions. After implementing the Transaction model, write tests to ensure that a new transaction can be created and that a user's transactions can be retrieved.", "Step 4: Implement the Budget model. This model should include fields for the monthly budget amount and the categories it applies to. Also, implement methods for setting a budget and retrieving a user's budget. After implementing the Budget model, write tests to ensure that a budget can be set and that a user's budget can be retrieved.", "Step 5: Implement the Investment model. This model should include fields for the investment account name, balance, and asset allocation. Also, implement methods for linking an investment account and retrieving a user's investment accounts. After implementing the Investment model, write tests to ensure that an investment account can be linked and that a user's investment accounts can be retrieved.", "Step 6: Implement the Alert model. This model should include fields for the alert type (e.g., nearing budget limit, unusual spending) and the message. Also, implement methods for creating an alert and retrieving a user's alerts. After implementing the Alert model, write tests to ensure that an alert can be created and that a user's alerts can be retrieved.", "Step 7: Implement the routes for the Flask application. This includes routes for creating a new user, authenticating a user, creating a new transaction, retrieving a user's transactions, setting a budget, retrieving a user's budget, linking an investment account, retrieving a user's investment accounts, creating an alert, and retrieving a user's alerts. After implementing the routes, write tests to ensure that each route works as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the logic for generating financial reports. This includes calculating the total income and expenses for a given period, calculating the remaining budget for each category, and calculating the performance of each investment account. After implementing the report generation logic, write tests to ensure that the reports are generated correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the logic for sending alerts. This includes checking if a user is nearing their budget limit, checking for unusual spending, and sending reminders for important dates. After implementing the alert sending logic, write tests to ensure that the alerts are sent correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, implement the logic for multi-factor authentication. This includes sending a verification code to the user's email when they try to log in and checking the code when they submit it. After implementing the multi-factor authentication logic, write tests to ensure that the multi-factor authentication works as expected."], "step": "Step 3: Implement the Transaction model.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
