In Python, mutable default arguments can lead to unexpected behavior because they are created only once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. Therefore, all instances of the User class share the same list object as the default value of the 'transactions' attribute, which is not the intended behavior.\n\nTo mitigate this, the plan would be to use the 'default_factory' option of the 'field' function from the 'dataclasses' module to create a new list for each User instance. The 'default_factory' option allows specifying a function that returns the initial value of the field. The '/add_transaction' route and the 'test_add_transaction' test should not need to be updated as they should work correctly with this change.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
