However, the remaining features such as secure login and authentication, income and expense tracking, bank account integration, budgeting and goals, investment tracking, analytics and reporting, savings tips and recommendations, notifications and alerts, data security and privacy, mobile app and web interface, and customer support were not implemented. \n\nThe possible reason for this discrepancy is the vast scope of the original task, which includes numerous complex features that require substantial time and effort to implement. \n\nTo mitigate this, a new high-level plan could be devised that breaks down the task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task would focus on implementing a specific feature of the personal finance tracker. This approach would allow for more focused and efficient coding, and would also make it easier to test and debug each feature individually. \n\nFor example, the first sub-task could focus on implementing a secure login and authentication system. Once this is completed and tested, the next sub-task could focus on implementing the income and expense tracking feature, and so on. This iterative approach would ensure that each feature is fully functional before moving on to the next, thereby increasing the overall quality and reliability of the final product.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests.
