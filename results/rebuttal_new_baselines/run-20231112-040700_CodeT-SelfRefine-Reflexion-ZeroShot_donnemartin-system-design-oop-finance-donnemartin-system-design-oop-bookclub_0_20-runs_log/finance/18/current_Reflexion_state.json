Alternatively, the test could be rewritten to only add one transaction and expect one transaction in the response. \n\nThe new plan is to update the test `test_get_transactions` in the `test_app.py` file to correctly expect two transactions in the response after adding two transactions for the user.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n# Mock database\\nusers = {}\\ntransactions = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tusername: str\\n\\tpassword: str\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Transaction:\\n\\tuser_id: str\\n\\tamount: float\\n\\tcategory: str\\n\\n@app.route('/create_user', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_user():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = User(**data)\\n\\tusers[user.username] = user\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'User created'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/add_transaction', methods=['POST'])\\ndef add_transaction():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\ttransaction = Transaction(**data)\\n\\ttransactions.setdefault(transaction.user_id, []).append(transaction)\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Transaction added'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/get_transactions/<user_id>', methods=['GET'])\\ndef get_transactions(user_id):\\n\\tuser_transactions = transactions.get(user_id, [])\\n\\treturn jsonify([t.__dict__ for t in user_transactions]), 200\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nfrom app import User, Transaction\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef sample_user():\\n\\treturn User(username='test', password='test')\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef sample_transaction():\\n\\treturn Transaction(user_id='test', amount=100.0, category='groceries')\\n\\n\\ndef test_create_user(client, sample_user):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/create_user', json=sample_user.__dict__)\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'User created'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_add_transaction(client, sample_transaction):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/add_transaction', json=sample_transaction.__dict__)\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'Transaction added'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_get_transactions(client, sample_transaction):\\n\\tclient.post('/add_transaction', json=sample_transaction.__dict__)\\n\\tclient.post('/add_transaction', json=sample_transaction.__dict__)\\n\\tresponse = client.get(f'/get_transactions/{sample_transaction.user_id}')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert len(response.get_json()) == 2\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.
