However, in the test cases, these methods are being called with arguments, which is causing the TypeError.\n\nTo mitigate this, the test cases should be rewritten to simulate HTTP requests to the Flask application, using the `test_client` object provided by Flask. This will allow the test cases to interact with the application in the same way a real client would, ensuring that the tests accurately reflect the application's behavior. The test cases should also be updated to check the HTTP response from the application, rather than checking the application's internal state directly. This will make the tests more robust and realistic.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
