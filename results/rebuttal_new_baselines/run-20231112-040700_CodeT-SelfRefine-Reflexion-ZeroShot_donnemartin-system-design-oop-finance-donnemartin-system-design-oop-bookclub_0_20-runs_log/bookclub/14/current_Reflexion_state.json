Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\nclubs = {}\\nusers = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tname: str\\n\\temail: str\\n\\tclubs: list\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Club:\\n\\tname: str\\n\\tdescription: str\\n\\tis_private: bool\\n\\tmembers: list\\n\\n@app.route('/create_club', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_club():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tclub = Club(data['name'], data['description'], data['is_private'], [])\\n\\tclubs[data['name']] = club\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Club created successfully'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/join_club', methods=['POST'])\\ndef join_club():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tclub = clubs.get(data['club_name'])\\n\\tif not club:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Club not found'}), 404\\n\\tif club.is_private and data['user_email'] not in club.members:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Cannot join private club without invitation'}), 403\\n\\tuser = users.get(data['user_email'])\\n\\tif not user:\\n\\t\\tuser = User(data['user_name'], data['user_email'], [])\\n\\t\\tusers[data['user_email']] = user\\n\\tuser.clubs.append(club.name)\\n\\tclub.members.append(user.email)\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Joined club successfully'}), 200\\n\\n@app.route('/invite_to_club', methods=['POST'])\\ndef invite_to_club():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tclub = clubs.get(data['club_name'])\\n\\tif not club:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Club not found'}), 404\\n\\tif data['user_email'] not in club.members:\\n\\t\\tclub.members.append(data['user_email'])\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'User invited successfully'}), 200\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nfrom flask import json\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\n\\ndef test_create_club(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/create_club', json={'name': 'Test Club', 'description': 'This is a test club', 'is_private': False})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert json.loads(response.data) == {'message': 'Club created successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_join_club(client):\\n\\tclient.post('/create_club', json={'name': 'Test Club', 'description': 'This is a test club', 'is_private': False})\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/join_club', json={'club_name': 'Test Club', 'user_name': 'Test User', 'user_email': 'test@example.com'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert json.loads(response.data) == {'message': 'Joined club successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_invite_to_club(client):\\n\\tclient.post('/create_club', json={'name': 'Test Club', 'description': 'This is a test club', 'is_private': True})\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/invite_to_club', json={'club_name': 'Test Club', 'user_email': 'test@example.com'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert json.loads(response.data) == {'message': 'User invited successfully'}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"All tests passed.\"}"}]}
