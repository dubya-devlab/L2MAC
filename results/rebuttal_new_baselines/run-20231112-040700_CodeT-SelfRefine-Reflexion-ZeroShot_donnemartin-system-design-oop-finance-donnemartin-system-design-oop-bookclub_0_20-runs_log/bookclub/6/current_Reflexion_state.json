This error occurred because the 'Book' class was not designed to keep track of the clubs it belongs to. This is a design flaw in the data model.\n\nTo mitigate this, the new plan would be to revise the data model. Specifically, the 'Book' class should be updated to include a 'clubs' attribute, which would be a list of club IDs. This would allow a book to keep track of the clubs it belongs to. The route '/club/<club_id>/add_book' should also be updated to append the club ID to the book's 'clubs' list when a book is added to a club. \n\nAdditionally, the test 'test_add_book_to_club' should be updated to reflect these changes. The test should now check that the book's 'clubs' list includes the club ID after the book is added to the club. \n\nBy making these changes, the code should be able to successfully add a book to a club and pass all tests.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests.
