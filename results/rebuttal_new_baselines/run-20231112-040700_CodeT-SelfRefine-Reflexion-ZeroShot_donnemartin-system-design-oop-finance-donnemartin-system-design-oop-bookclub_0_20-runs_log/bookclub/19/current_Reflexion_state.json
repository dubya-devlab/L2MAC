However, it did not implement the feature of users joining clubs, which is a significant part of the original specification. This is likely the reason for the lower evaluation score.\n\nTo improve this, the new plan would be to add an endpoint in the Flask application for users to join clubs. This endpoint would take in the user's ID and the club's ID, add the user to the club's members, and add the club to the user's clubs. The test file would also need to be updated to include tests for this new feature. This would ensure that all the original features specified are implemented in the code.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
