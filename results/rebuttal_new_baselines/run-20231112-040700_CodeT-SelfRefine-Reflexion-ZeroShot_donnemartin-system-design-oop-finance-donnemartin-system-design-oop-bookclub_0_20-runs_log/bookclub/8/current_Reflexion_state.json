Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n# Mock database\\nusers = {}\\nclubs = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tname: str\\n\\temail: str\\n\\tclubs: list\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Club:\\n\\tname: str\\n\\tdescription: str\\n\\tmembers: list\\n\\n@app.route('/create_user', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_user():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = User(data['name'], data['email'], [])\\n\\tusers[data['email']] = user\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'User created successfully'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/create_club', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_club():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tclub = Club(data['name'], data['description'], [])\\n\\tclubs[data['name']] = club\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Club created successfully'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/join_club', methods=['POST'])\\ndef join_club():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users[data['email']]\\n\\tclub = clubs[data['name']]\\n\\tuser.clubs.append(club.name)\\n\\tclub.members.append(user.email)\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Joined club successfully'}), 200\\n\\n@app.route('/list_clubs', methods=['GET'])\\ndef list_clubs():\\n\\treturn jsonify({'clubs': list(clubs.keys())}), 200\\n\\n@app.route('/list_users', methods=['GET'])\\ndef list_users():\\n\\treturn jsonify({'users': list(users.keys())}), 200\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nfrom flask import json\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\n\\ndef test_create_user(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/create_user', json={'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert json.loads(response.data) == {'message': 'User created successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_create_club(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/create_club', json={'name': 'Book Club', 'description': 'A club for book lovers'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert json.loads(response.data) == {'message': 'Club created successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_join_club(client):\\n\\tclient.post('/create_user', json={'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'})\\n\\tclient.post('/create_club', json={'name': 'Book Club', 'description': 'A club for book lovers'})\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/join_club', json={'email': 'john@example.com', 'name': 'Book Club'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert json.loads(response.data) == {'message': 'Joined club successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_list_clubs(client):\\n\\tclient.post('/create_club', json={'name': 'Book Club', 'description': 'A club for book lovers'})\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/list_clubs')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert 'Book Club' in json.loads(response.data)['clubs']\\n\\n\\ndef test_list_users(client):\\n\\tclient.post('/create_user', json={'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'})\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/list_users')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert 'john@example.com' in json.loads(response.data)['users']\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"All tests passed.\"}"}]}
