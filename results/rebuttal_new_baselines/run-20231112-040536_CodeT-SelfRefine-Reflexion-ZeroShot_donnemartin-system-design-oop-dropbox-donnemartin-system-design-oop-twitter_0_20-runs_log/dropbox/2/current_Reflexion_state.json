However, it did not implement features like forgot password, user profile management, file size and type restrictions, file/folder organization, file sharing, encryption, activity log, and UI/UX features.\n\nThe discrepancy might be due to the complexity and breadth of the original task, which requires a comprehensive cloud storage service with numerous features. The generated code only implemented a basic version of such a service.\n\nTo mitigate this, a new plan could involve breaking down the task into smaller, manageable subtasks. Each subtask would focus on implementing a specific feature of the service. This approach would allow for more focused and detailed code generation for each feature, increasing the likelihood of fully implementing the original task. The plan would start with the implementation of core functionalities (user management and file management), followed by additional features (file sharing, security, and UI/UX).\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests.
