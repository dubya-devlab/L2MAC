Specifically, it provides basic user account management (registration, login, profile viewing), and file management (upload, download, versioning). However, it does not implement many of the other features, such as file organization, file sharing, encryption, activity logging, and UI/UX features.\n\nThe discrepancy could be due to the complexity and breadth of the original feature set, which includes both backend and frontend functionalities. The generated code focused on the backend functionalities, and did not include frontend or UI/UX related features.\n\nTo mitigate this, a new plan could involve breaking down the task into smaller, more manageable subtasks. Each subtask could focus on implementing a specific feature or set of related features. This would allow for a more focused and incremental approach to building the system. Additionally, more time and resources could be allocated to implementing frontend and UI/UX features, as these were not addressed in the generated code.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\nfrom typing import Dict\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n# Mock database\\nusers = {}\\nfiles = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tname: str\\n\\temail: str\\n\\tpassword: str\\n\\tstorage_used: int = 0\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass File:\\n\\tname: str\\n\\tsize: int\\n\\tversions: list\\n\\n@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])\\ndef register():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = User(**data)\\n\\tusers[user.email] = user\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'User registered successfully'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\\ndef login():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\temail = data.get('email')\\n\\tpassword = data.get('password')\\n\\tuser = users.get(email)\\n\\tif not user or user.password != password:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Invalid email or password'}), 401\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Logged in successfully'}), 200\\n\\n@app.route('/profile', methods=['GET'])\\ndef profile():\\n\\temail = request.args.get('email')\\n\\tuser = users.get(email)\\n\\tif not user:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'User not found'}), 404\\n\\treturn jsonify(user.__dict__), 200\\n\\n@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])\\ndef upload():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tfile = File(**data)\\n\\tfiles[file.name] = file\\n\\tuser = users.get(data.get('email'))\\n\\tuser.storage_used += file.size\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'File uploaded successfully'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/download', methods=['GET'])\\ndef download():\\n\\tfilename = request.args.get('filename')\\n\\tfile = files.get(filename)\\n\\tif not file:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'File not found'}), 404\\n\\treturn jsonify(file.__dict__), 200\\n\\n@app.route('/version', methods=['POST'])\\ndef version():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tfilename = data.get('filename')\\n\\tversion = data.get('version')\\n\\tfile = files.get(filename)\\n\\tif not file:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'File not found'}), 404\\n\\tfile.versions.append(version)\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Version added successfully'}), 200\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nfrom app import User, File\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef sample_user():\\n\\treturn User('Test User', 'test@example.com', 'password')\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef sample_file():\\n\\treturn File('test.txt', 100, [])\\n\\n\\ndef test_register(client, sample_user):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/register', json=sample_user.__dict__)\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'User registered successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_login(client, sample_user):\\n\\tapp.users[sample_user.email] = sample_user\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/login', json={'email': sample_user.email, 'password': sample_user.password})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'Logged in successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_profile(client, sample_user):\\n\\tapp.users[sample_user.email] = sample_user\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/profile', query_string={'email': sample_user.email})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == sample_user.__dict__\\n\\n\\ndef test_upload(client, sample_user, sample_file):\\n\\tapp.users[sample_user.email] = sample_user\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/upload', json={**sample_file.__dict__, 'email': sample_user.email})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'File uploaded successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_download(client, sample_file):\\n\\tapp.files[sample_file.name] = sample_file\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/download', query_string={'filename': sample_file.name})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == sample_file.__dict__\\n\\n\\ndef test_version(client, sample_file):\\n\\tapp.files[sample_file.name] = sample_file\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/version', json={'filename': sample_file.name, 'version': 'v2'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'Version added successfully'}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.

No data saved to disk will persis between steps or write operations.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n                                       \nPython toolbelt preferences:\n- pytest\n- dataclasses\n- flask\n\nObjective:```\n**1.

Specifically, it provides basic user account management (registration, login, profile viewing), and file management (upload, download, versioning). However, it does not implement many of the other features, such as file organization, file sharing, encryption, activity logging, and UI/UX features.\n\nThe discrepancy could be due to the complexity and breadth of the original feature set, which includes both backend and frontend functionalities. The generated code focused on the backend functionalities, and did not include frontend or UI/UX related features.\n\nTo mitigate this, a new plan could involve breaking down the task into smaller, more manageable subtasks. Each subtask could focus on implementing a specific feature or set of related features. This would allow for a more focused and incremental approach to building the system. Additionally, more time and resources could be allocated to implementing frontend and UI/UX features, as these were not addressed in the generated code.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\nfrom typing import Dict\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n# Mock database\\nusers = {}\\nfiles = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tname: str\\n\\temail: str\\n\\tpassword: str\\n\\tstorage_used: int = 0\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass File:\\n\\tname: str\\n\\tsize: int\\n\\tversions: list\\n\\n@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])\\ndef register():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = User(**data)\\n\\tusers[user.email] = user\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'User registered successfully'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\\ndef login():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\temail = data.get('email')\\n\\tpassword = data.get('password')\\n\\tuser = users.get(email)\\n\\tif not user or user.password != password:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Invalid email or password'}), 401\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Logged in successfully'}), 200\\n\\n@app.route('/profile', methods=['GET'])\\ndef profile():\\n\\temail = request.args.get('email')\\n\\tuser = users.get(email)\\n\\tif not user:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'User not found'}), 404\\n\\treturn jsonify(user.__dict__), 200\\n\\n@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])\\ndef upload():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tfile = File(**data)\\n\\tfiles[file.name] = file\\n\\tuser = users.get(data.get('email'))\\n\\tuser.storage_used += file.size\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'File uploaded successfully'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/download', methods=['GET'])\\ndef download():\\n\\tfilename = request.args.get('filename')\\n\\tfile = files.get(filename)\\n\\tif not file:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'File not found'}), 404\\n\\treturn jsonify(file.__dict__), 200\\n\\n@app.route('/version', methods=['POST'])\\ndef version():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tfilename = data.get('filename')\\n\\tversion = data.get('version')\\n\\tfile = files.get(filename)\\n\\tif not file:\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'File not found'}), 404\\n\\tfile.versions.append(version)\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Version added successfully'}), 200\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nfrom app import User, File\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef sample_user():\\n\\treturn User('Test User', 'test@example.com', 'password')\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef sample_file():\\n\\treturn File('test.txt', 100, [])\\n\\n\\ndef test_register(client, sample_user):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/register', json=sample_user.__dict__)\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'User registered successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_login(client, sample_user):\\n\\tapp.users[sample_user.email] = sample_user\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/login', json={'email': sample_user.email, 'password': sample_user.password})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'Logged in successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_profile(client, sample_user):\\n\\tapp.users[sample_user.email] = sample_user\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/profile', query_string={'email': sample_user.email})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == sample_user.__dict__\\n\\n\\ndef test_upload(client, sample_user, sample_file):\\n\\tapp.users[sample_user.email] = sample_user\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/upload', json={**sample_file.__dict__, 'email': sample_user.email})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'File uploaded successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_download(client, sample_file):\\n\\tapp.files[sample_file.name] = sample_file\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/download', query_string={'filename': sample_file.name})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == sample_file.__dict__\\n\\n\\ndef test_version(client, sample_file):\\n\\tapp.files[sample_file.name] = sample_file\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/version', json={'filename': sample_file.name, 'version': 'v2'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message': 'Version added successfully'}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.
