Starting with the backend, we could first implement file versioning and file sharing features. Then, we could add encryption for file storage and transmission. After that, we could implement an activity log to track user actions. Finally, we could work on the frontend to improve the UI/UX, making it responsive and adding features like file preview and themes. \n\nFor testing, we should write unit tests for each new feature as it is implemented, and run these tests to ensure the feature works as expected before moving on to the next one.
