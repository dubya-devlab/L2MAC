The error message indicated that the module could not be found, which suggests that the package was not installed in the environment where the code was being run.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, I included the 'flask_jwt_extended' package in the 'requirements.txt' file and wrote the code to install all necessary Python packages before running the code. However, the tests still failed due to the missing package. This suggests that the package installation step was not executed correctly or the environment where the tests were run did not have the necessary permissions to install packages.\n\nIn the future, I will ensure that the environment setup and package installation steps are executed correctly before running the code.
