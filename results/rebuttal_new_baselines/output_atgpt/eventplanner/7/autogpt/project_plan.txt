Project Plan for Web-Based Event Planning Application:
1. Develop a web-based application that allows users to create and manage events, customize event details, and view events in a calendar view.

3. Create a guest list management system that allows users to create and manage guest lists, import/export guest lists, and track RSVPs.
4. Develop a platform for users to connect with event service providers, view and compare vendor profiles and reviews, and communicate with vendors through an in-app messaging system.
5. Implement a budget management feature that allows users to set a budget for the event, track budget breakdown by categories, and receive alerts for budget overruns.
6. Create user accounts and profiles with customization options, and enable users to save and access past and upcoming events.
7. Implement automated notifications for event milestones and customizable reminders for tasks and deadlines.
8. Generate reports on event success metrics and collect feedback from guests and vendors post-event.
