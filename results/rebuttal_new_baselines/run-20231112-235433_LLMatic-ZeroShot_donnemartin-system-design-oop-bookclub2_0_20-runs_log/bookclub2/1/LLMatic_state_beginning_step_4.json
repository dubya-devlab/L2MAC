This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'models.py' file to define the data models for the application. These models will include 'User', 'BookClub', 'Meeting', 'Discussion', 'Comment', 'Vote', 'Profile', 'Follow', 'ReadingList', 'Recommendation', 'Dashboard', 'Moderation', 'Analytics'. Each model will represent a table in the database and will include fields relevant to its function. For example, the 'User' model will have fields like 'username', 'email', 'password_hash', etc. After setting up the basic structure and defining the models, write tests to ensure that the models are defined correctly and can interact with the database as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the functionality for users to create and join book clubs. This will involve creating routes in the Flask application that handle the creation and joining of book clubs. The 'create' route will create a new 'BookClub' instance and save it to the database, while the 'join' route will add a user to a book club's list of members. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can create and join book clubs as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the functionality for club creators to set club privacy settings. This will involve adding a 'privacy' field to the 'BookClub' model and creating routes that allow the club creator to change this field. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that club creators can set club privacy settings as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the functionality for club administrators to manage member roles and permissions. This will involve adding a 'role' field to the 'User' model and creating routes that allow the club administrator to change this field for members of their club. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that club administrators can manage member roles and permissions as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the integrated calendar for scheduling club meetings. This will involve creating a 'Meeting' model with fields for the date and time of the meeting, and creating routes that allow club administrators to schedule meetings. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that club administrators can schedule meetings as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the automated reminders for upcoming meetings. This will involve setting up a task that runs at regular intervals and sends reminders to all members of a club about upcoming meetings. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that reminders are sent as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the forums for book discussions in each club. This will involve creating a 'Discussion' model with fields for the topic and content of the discussion, and creating routes that allow users to create and view discussions. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can create and view discussions as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the threaded commenting system in forums. This will involve creating a 'Comment' model with fields for the content of the comment and the discussion it belongs to, and creating routes that allow users to create and view comments. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can create and view comments as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the voting system for selecting the club's next book. This will involve creating a 'Vote' model with fields for the book being voted on and the user who cast the vote, and creating routes that allow users to cast and view votes. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can cast and view votes as expected.", "Step 10: Implement the personalized profiles for users. This will involve adding fields to the 'User' model for profile information, and creating routes that allow users to view and edit their profile. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can view and edit their profile as expected."], "step": "Step 5: Implement the integrated calendar for scheduling club meetings.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
