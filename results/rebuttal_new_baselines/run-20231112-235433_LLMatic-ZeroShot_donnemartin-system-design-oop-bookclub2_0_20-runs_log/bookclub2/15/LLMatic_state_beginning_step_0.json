Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write a basic Flask application in app.py that will serve as the entry point of the application. Make sure to include routes for each of the main components. Write tests to ensure that the application runs and that each route is accessible.", "Step 2: Implement the Book Club Management feature. In book_club.py, define a BookClub class with methods for creating and joining a book club, and setting privacy settings. The BookClub class should also include methods for managing member roles and permissions. Use an in-memory dictionary to store book club data. Write tests in test_book_club.py to ensure that each method works as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the Meeting and Scheduling feature. In meeting.py, define a Meeting class with methods for scheduling meetings and setting reminders. The Meeting class should be associated with a BookClub instance. Use an in-memory dictionary to store meeting data. Write tests in test_meeting.py to ensure that each method works as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the Discussion and Interaction feature. In discussion.py, define a Discussion class with methods for creating forums, posting comments, and voting for books. The Discussion class should be associated with a BookClub instance. Use an in-memory dictionary to store discussion data. Write tests in test_discussion.py to ensure that each method works as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the User Profiles and Networking feature. In user.py, define a User class with methods for creating profiles, following other users, and managing reading lists and recommendations. Use an in-memory dictionary to store user data. Write tests in test_user.py to ensure that each method works as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the Administration and Analytics feature. In admin.py, define an Admin class with methods for managing content and users, and generating analytics. The Admin class should have access to all other classes. Write tests in test_admin.py to ensure that each method works as expected.", "Step 7: Integrate all the components in the main application file (app.py). This includes setting up routes for each component and handling requests and responses.

Repeat this process until all tests pass.", "Step 9: Once all tests pass, review the code to ensure that it follows best practices for code quality and readability. This includes proper indentation, use of comments, and adherence to naming conventions.", "Step 10: Finally, write a comprehensive test suite that covers all features and edge cases. Run this test suite to ensure that the application works as expected under all conditions. If any test fails, debug the code and fix the issue.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
