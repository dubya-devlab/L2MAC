"steps": ["Step 1: Start by setting up the basic structure of the application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up the Flask application. Also, create a 'models.py' file to define the data models for the application. These models will include 'User', 'BookClub', 'Meeting', 'Discussion', 'Comment', 'Vote', 'Profile', 'Follow', 'ReadingList', 'Recommendation', 'Dashboard', 'Moderation', 'Analytics'. Each model will represent a table in the database and will include fields relevant to its function. For example, the 'User' model will have fields like 'username', 'email', 'password_hash', etc. After setting up the basic structure and defining the models, write tests to ensure that the models are defined correctly and can interact with the database as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the functionality for users to create and join book clubs. This will involve creating routes in the 'app.py' file for 'create_club' and 'join_club'. The 'create_club' route will handle POST requests and will create a new book club with the current user as the creator. The 'join_club' route will handle POST requests and will add the current user to the members of the specified book club. After implementing these routes, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the functionality for club creators to set club privacy settings. This will involve adding a 'privacy' field to the 'BookClub' model and creating a route in the 'app.py' file for 'set_privacy'. The 'set_privacy' route will handle POST requests and will update the privacy setting of the specified book club. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the functionality for club administrators to manage member roles and permissions. This will involve adding a 'role' field to the 'User' model and creating routes in the 'app.py' file for 'assign_role' and 'set_permissions'. The 'assign_role' route will handle POST requests and will assign a specified role to a specified user in a specified book club. The 'set_permissions' route will handle POST requests and will set the permissions for a specified role in a specified book club. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the functionality for scheduling club meetings and sending automated reminders. This will involve creating a 'Meeting' model with fields like 'date', 'time', 'location', and 'club_id'. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file for 'schedule_meeting' and 'send_reminders'. The 'schedule_meeting' route will handle POST requests and will create a new meeting for a specified book club. The 'send_reminders' route will handle GET requests and will send reminders to all members of the specified book club about the upcoming meeting. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the functionality for book discussions, threaded commenting, and voting for the next book. This will involve creating 'Discussion', 'Comment', and 'Vote' models and corresponding routes in the 'app.py' file. The 'Discussion' model will have fields like 'title', 'content', 'club_id', and 'user_id'. The 'Comment' model will have fields like 'content', 'discussion_id', and 'user_id'. The 'Vote' model will have fields like 'book_id', 'club_id', and 'user_id'. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the functionality for user profiles, following other readers, and displaying reading lists and recommendations. This will involve creating 'Profile', 'Follow', 'ReadingList', and 'Recommendation' models and corresponding routes in the 'app.py' file. The 'Profile' model will have fields like 'user_id', 'bio', and 'location'. The 'Follow' model will have fields like 'follower_id' and 'followee_id'. The 'ReadingList' model will have fields like 'user_id' and 'book_id'. The 'Recommendation' model will have fields like 'user_id', 'book_id', and 'content'. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the functionality for the administration dashboard, content moderation, and user management. This will involve creating a 'Dashboard' model with fields like 'admin_id', 'club_id', and 'content'. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file for 'view_dashboard', 'moderate_content', and 'manage_users'. The 'view_dashboard' route will handle GET requests and will display the dashboard for the specified admin. The 'moderate_content' route will handle POST requests and will update the status of the specified content. The 'manage_users' route will handle POST requests and will update the status of the specified user. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the functionality for analytics on user engagement and popular books. This will involve creating an 'Analytics' model with fields like 'user_id', 'book_id', 'engagement_score', and 'popularity_score'. Also, create a route in the 'app.py' file for 'view_analytics'. The 'view_analytics' route will handle GET requests and will display the analytics for the specified user or book. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire application to ensure that all functionalities are implemented correctly and that the application is robust and secure. Run all tests to ensure that they all pass. If any tests fail, debug the application to identify and fix the issues causing the failures. Once all tests pass, the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "Step 2: Implement the functionality for users to create and join book clubs. This will involve creating routes in the 'app.py' file for 'create_club' and 'join_club'. The 'create_club' route will handle POST requests and will create a new book club with the current user as the creator.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
