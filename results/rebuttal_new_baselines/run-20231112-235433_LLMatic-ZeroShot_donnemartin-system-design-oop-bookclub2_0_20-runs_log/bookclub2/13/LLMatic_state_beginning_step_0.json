This includes the main application file (app.py), a file for each of the main components (book_club.py, meeting.py, discussion.py, user.py, admin.py), and a file for the mock database (database.py). Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies. Write tests to ensure that all files are created successfully and that the project structure is correct.", "Step 2: Implement the User class in the user.py file. This class should have attributes such as username, password, email, reading_list, and recommendations. It should also have methods for creating a new user, updating user information, and deleting a user. Write tests to ensure that the User class is implemented correctly and that all its methods work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the BookClub class in the book_club.py file. This class should have attributes such as name, privacy_settings, members, and administrators. It should also have methods for creating a new book club, adding and removing members, and updating club information. Write tests to ensure that the BookClub class is implemented correctly and that all its methods work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the Meeting class in the meeting.py file. This class should have attributes such as date, time, attendees, and reminders. It should also have methods for scheduling a new meeting, updating meeting details, and sending reminders. Write tests to ensure that the Meeting class is implemented correctly and that all its methods work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the Discussion class in the discussion.py file. This class should have attributes such as topic, comments, and votes. It should also have methods for creating a new discussion, adding comments, and voting. Write tests to ensure that the Discussion class is implemented correctly and that all its methods work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the Admin class in the admin.py file. This class should have attributes such as dashboard, moderation_tools, and analytics. It should also have methods for managing content and users, and for viewing analytics. Write tests to ensure that the Admin class is implemented correctly and that all its methods work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the mock database in the database.py file. This should be an in-memory dictionary that stores data for users, book clubs, meetings, discussions, and admins. Write tests to ensure that the mock database is implemented correctly and that it can store and retrieve data as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the main application in the app.py file. This should use the Flask framework to create routes for each of the main components. Write tests to ensure that the application is implemented correctly and that all routes work as expected.", "Step 9: Run all tests to ensure that all components are working together as expected. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues. Once all tests pass, the implementation of the virtual book club platform is complete.", "Step 10: Finally, document the entire project. This includes adding comments to the code, writing a README file that explains how to use the platform, and creating a CONTRIBUTING file that explains how others can contribute to the project.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
