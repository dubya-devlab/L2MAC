For example, the 'User' model will have fields like 'username', 'email', 'password', etc. The 'BookClub' model will have fields like 'name', 'privacy_setting', 'creator', etc. After setting up the basic structure and defining the models, write tests to ensure that the models are defined correctly and can be interacted with as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the functionality for users to create and join book clubs. This will involve creating routes in the Flask application that handle the creation and joining of book clubs. The 'create' route will create a new 'BookClub' instance and save it to the database. The 'join' route will add a user to a book club's list of members. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can create and join book clubs as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the functionality for club creators to set club privacy settings. This will involve adding a 'privacy_setting' field to the 'BookClub' model and creating a route that allows the club creator to update this field. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that club creators can set privacy settings as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the functionality for club administrators to manage member roles and permissions. This will involve adding a 'role' field to the 'User' model and creating routes that allow the club administrator to update this field for any member of their club. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that club administrators can manage member roles and permissions as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the integrated calendar for scheduling club meetings. This will involve creating a 'Meeting' model with fields like 'date', 'time', 'location', etc. and creating routes that allow club administrators to create, update, and delete meetings. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that the integrated calendar works as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the automated reminders for upcoming meetings. This will involve setting up a task that runs at regular intervals and sends reminders to all members of a club about upcoming meetings. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that automated reminders are sent as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the forums for book discussions in each club. This will involve creating a 'Discussion' model with fields like 'title', 'content', etc. and creating routes that allow users to create, update, and delete discussions. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that the forums work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the threaded commenting system in forums. This will involve creating a 'Comment' model with fields like 'content', 'parent_comment', etc. and creating routes that allow users to create, update, and delete comments. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that the threaded commenting system works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the voting system for selecting the club's next book. This will involve creating a 'Vote' model with fields like 'book', 'user', etc. and creating routes that allow users to create, update, and delete votes. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that the voting system works as expected.", "Step 10: Implement the personalized profiles for users, follow system to connect with other readers, display of users' reading lists and recommendations, dashboard for platform administrators, tools for content moderation and user management, and analytics on user engagement and popular books. Each of these features will involve creating appropriate models and routes. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that they work as expected."], "step": "Step 6: Implement the automated reminders for upcoming meetings.
