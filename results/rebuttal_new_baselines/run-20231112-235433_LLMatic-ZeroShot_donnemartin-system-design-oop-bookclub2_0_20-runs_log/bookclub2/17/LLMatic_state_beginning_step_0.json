This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up the Flask application. Also, create a 'models.py' file to define the data models for the application. These models will include 'User', 'BookClub', 'Meeting', 'Discussion', 'Comment', 'Vote', 'Profile', 'Follow', 'ReadingList', 'Recommendation', 'Dashboard', 'Moderation', 'Analytics'. Each model will represent a table in the database and will include fields relevant to its function. For example, the 'User' model will have fields like 'username', 'email', 'password_hash', etc. After setting up the basic structure and defining the models, write tests to ensure that the models are defined correctly and the application setup is correct.", "Step 2: Implement the functionality for users to create or join book clubs. This will involve creating routes in the Flask application for 'create_club' and 'join_club'. The 'create_club' route will handle the logic for creating a new book club and adding it to the database. The 'join_club' route will handle the logic for a user joining an existing book club. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can successfully create and join book clubs.", "Step 3: Implement the functionality for club creators to set club privacy settings. This will involve adding a 'privacy' field to the 'BookClub' model and creating a route for 'set_privacy'. The 'set_privacy' route will handle the logic for setting the privacy of a book club. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that club creators can successfully set the privacy of their book clubs.", "Step 4: Implement the functionality for club administrators to manage member roles and permissions. This will involve creating a 'Role' model and a 'Permission' model. The 'Role' model will represent the different roles a user can have in a book club (e.g., member, administrator), and the 'Permission' model will represent the different permissions a role can have (e.g., create meeting, delete comment). After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that club administrators can successfully manage member roles and permissions.", "Step 5: Implement the functionality for scheduling club meetings and sending automated reminders. This will involve creating a 'Meeting' model and routes for 'schedule_meeting' and 'send_reminder'. The 'schedule_meeting' route will handle the logic for scheduling a new meeting, and the 'send_reminder' route will handle the logic for sending reminders for upcoming meetings. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that meetings can be successfully scheduled and reminders can be successfully sent.", "Step 6: Implement the functionality for book discussions, threaded commenting, and voting for the next book. This will involve creating a 'Discussion' model, a 'Comment' model, and a 'Vote' model. The 'Discussion' model will represent a discussion thread in a book club, the 'Comment' model will represent a comment in a discussion, and the 'Vote' model will represent a vote for the next book. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that discussions can be created, comments can be posted, and votes can be cast.", "Step 7: Implement the functionality for user profiles, following other readers, and displaying reading lists and recommendations. This will involve creating a 'Profile' model, a 'Follow' model, a 'ReadingList' model, and a 'Recommendation' model. The 'Profile' model will represent a user's profile, the 'Follow' model will represent a follow relationship between two users, the 'ReadingList' model will represent a user's reading list, and the 'Recommendation' model will represent a book recommendation. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that profiles can be created, users can follow each other, reading lists can be displayed, and recommendations can be made.", "Step 8: Implement the functionality for the platform administration dashboard, content moderation, and user management. This will involve creating a 'Dashboard' model, a 'Moderation' model, and routes for 'moderate_content' and 'manage_users'. The 'Dashboard' model will represent the administration dashboard, and the 'Moderation' model will represent a moderation action. The 'moderate_content' route will handle the logic for moderating content, and the 'manage_users' route will handle the logic for managing users. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that the administration dashboard works correctly, content can be moderated, and users can be managed.", "Step 9: Implement the functionality for analytics on user engagement and popular books. This will involve creating an 'Analytics' model and a route for 'get_analytics'. The 'Analytics' model will represent an analytics report, and the 'get_analytics' route will handle the logic for generating and retrieving analytics reports. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that analytics reports can be generated and retrieved.", "Step 10: Finally, integrate all the parts of the application and perform end-to-end testing. This will involve running the application and performing a series of tests to ensure that all the functionalities work together as expected. After performing end-to-end testing, fix any issues that are found and retest until the application works correctly."], "step": "Step 1: Start by setting up the basic structure of the application.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
