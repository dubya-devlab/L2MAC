Each model will represent a table in the database and will include fields relevant to its function. For example, the 'User' model will have fields like 'username', 'email', 'password_hash', etc. After setting up the basic structure and defining the models, write tests to ensure that the models are defined correctly and the application setup is correct.", "Step 2: Implement the functionality for users to create or join book clubs. This will involve creating routes in the Flask application for 'create_club' and 'join_club'. The 'create_club' route will handle the logic for creating a new book club and adding it to the database. The 'join_club' route will handle the logic for a user joining an existing book club. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can successfully create and join book clubs.", "Step 3: Implement the functionality for club creators to set club privacy settings.

After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that club creators can successfully set the privacy of their book clubs.", "Step 4: Implement the functionality for club administrators to manage member roles and permissions.

After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that club administrators can successfully manage member roles and permissions.", "Step 5: Implement the functionality for scheduling club meetings and sending automated reminders. This will involve creating a 'Meeting' model and routes for 'schedule_meeting' and 'send_reminder'. The 'schedule_meeting' route will handle the logic for scheduling a new meeting, and the 'send_reminder' route will handle the logic for sending reminders for upcoming meetings. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that meetings can be successfully scheduled and reminders can be successfully sent.", "Step 6: Implement the functionality for book discussions, threaded commenting, and voting for the next book. This will involve creating a 'Discussion' model, a 'Comment' model, and a 'Vote' model. The 'Discussion' model will represent a discussion thread in a book club, the 'Comment' model will represent a comment in a discussion, and the 'Vote' model will represent a vote for the next book. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that discussions can be created, comments can be posted, and votes can be cast.", "Step 7: Implement the functionality for user profiles, following other readers, and displaying reading lists and recommendations. This will involve creating a 'Profile' model, a 'Follow' model, a 'ReadingList' model, and a 'Recommendation' model. The 'Profile' model will represent a user's profile, the 'Follow' model will represent a follow relationship between two users, the 'ReadingList' model will represent a user's reading list, and the 'Recommendation' model will represent a book recommendation. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that profiles can be created, users can follow each other, reading lists can be displayed, and recommendations can be made.", "Step 8: Implement the functionality for the platform administration dashboard, content moderation, and user management. This will involve creating a 'Dashboard' model, a 'Moderation' model, and routes for 'moderate_content' and 'manage_users'. The 'Dashboard' model will represent the administration dashboard, and the 'Moderation' model will represent a moderation action. The 'moderate_content' route will handle the logic for moderating content, and the 'manage_users' route will handle the logic for managing users. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that the administration dashboard works correctly, content can be moderated, and users can be managed.", "Step 9: Implement the functionality for analytics on user engagement and popular books. This will involve creating an 'Analytics' model and a route for 'get_analytics'. The 'Analytics' model will represent an analytics report, and the 'get_analytics' route will handle the logic for generating and retrieving analytics reports. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that analytics reports can be generated and retrieved.", "Step 10: Finally, integrate all the parts of the application and perform end-to-end testing.

You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nObjective: Execute sub task step: Step 4: Implement the functionality for club administrators to manage member roles and permissions. This will involve creating a 'Role' model and a 'Permission' model. The 'Role' model will represent the different roles a user can have in a book club (e.g., member, administrator), and the 'Permission' model will represent the different permissions a role can have (e.g., create meeting, delete comment). After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that club administrators can successfully manage member roles and permissions. \n\n Note: Condition any new code files on the existing code files: ['app.py', 'models.py', 'test_app.py', 'test_models.py'] Fully implement these features in the code, no placeholders. You can now optionally view the existing files if you need to view them to complete the current task step. You have a limited context window so be selective about which files you view, only view the files you think you might need to view. \n\n The code for managing roles and permissions has been implemented and tests have been written, but the test for joining a club is failing because the user does not exist in the mock database. I need to fix this issue to complete the task.\n\nRespond now only with a function call of one of the following functions provided: `sub_task_step_complete`, `view_files`, `run_python_file`,
