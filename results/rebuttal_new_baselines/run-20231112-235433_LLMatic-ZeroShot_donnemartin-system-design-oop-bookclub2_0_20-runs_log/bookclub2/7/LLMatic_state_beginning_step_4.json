basic structure of the application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'models.py' file to define the data models for the application. These models will include 'User', 'BookClub', 'Meeting', 'Discussion', 'Comment', 'Vote', 'Profile', 'Follow', 'ReadingList', 'Recommendation', 'Dashboard', 'Moderation', 'Analytics'. Each of these models will correspond to a feature requirement specified above. At this stage, mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the data models are defined correctly.", "Step 2: Implement the 'User' model in 'models.py'. This model will represent a user in the application and will have fields such as 'username', 'email', 'password', etc. Also, implement the 'Profile' model which will represent a user's profile and will have fields such as 'bio', 'location', etc. The 'User' model will have a one-to-one relationship with the 'Profile' model. After implementing these models, write tests to ensure that the models are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the 'BookClub' model in 'models.py'. This model will represent a book club in the application and will have fields such as 'name', 'description', 'privacy', etc. The 'BookClub' model will have a many-to-many relationship with the 'User' model, representing the users that are members of the book club. Also, implement the 'Meeting' model which will represent a meeting in a book club and will have fields such as 'date', 'time', 'location', etc. The 'Meeting' model will have a many-to-one relationship with the 'BookClub' model. After implementing these models, write tests to ensure that the models are working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the 'Discussion' and 'Comment' models in 'models.py'. The 'Discussion' model will represent a discussion in a book club and will have fields such as 'title', 'content', etc. The 'Comment' model will represent a comment in a discussion and will have fields such as 'content', 'user_id', etc. The 'Discussion' model will have a many-to-one relationship with the 'BookClub' model and the 'Comment' model will have a many-to-one relationship with the 'Discussion' model. After implementing these models, write tests to ensure that the models are working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the 'Vote' model in 'models.py'. This model will represent a vote in a book club for selecting the next book and will have fields such as 'book_name', 'user_id', etc. The 'Vote' model will have a many-to-one relationship with the 'BookClub' model. After implementing this model, write tests to ensure that the model is working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the 'Follow' model in 'models.py'. This model will represent a follow relationship between two users and will have fields such as 'follower_id', 'followed_id', etc. The 'Follow' model will have a many-to-many relationship with the 'User' model. Also, implement the 'ReadingList' and 'Recommendation' models which will represent a user's reading list and recommendations respectively. These models will have a many-to-one relationship with the 'User' model. After implementing these models, write tests to ensure that the models are working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the 'Dashboard', 'Moderation', and 'Analytics' models in 'models.py'. The 'Dashboard' model will represent a dashboard for platform administrators and will have fields such as 'admin_id', 'content', etc. The 'Moderation' model will represent a moderation tool for content and users and will have fields such as 'moderator_id', 'content_id', etc. The 'Analytics' model will represent an analytics tool for user engagement and popular books and will have fields such as 'user_id', 'book_id', etc. These models will have a many-to-one relationship with the 'User' model. After implementing these models, write tests to ensure that the models are working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the routes for the application in 'app.py'. These routes will include routes for user registration, user login, creating a book club, joining a book club, scheduling a meeting, creating a discussion, commenting on a discussion, voting for a book, following a user, adding a book to the reading list, recommending a book, viewing the dashboard, moderating content, and viewing analytics. After implementing these routes, write tests to ensure that the routes are working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the views for the application. These views will include views for the user registration page, user login page, book club creation page, book club page, meeting scheduling page, discussion creation page, discussion page, voting page, user profile page, reading list page, recommendation page, dashboard page, moderation page, and analytics page. After implementing these views, write tests to ensure that the views are working correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, run the application and perform a series of tests to ensure that all the features are working as expected. These tests will include creating a user, logging in as a user, creating a book club, joining a book club, scheduling a meeting, creating a discussion, commenting on a discussion, voting for a book, following a user, adding a book to the reading list, recommending a book, viewing the dashboard, moderating content, and viewing analytics. After performing these tests, fix any issues that arise and ensure that all tests pass."], "step": "Step 5: Implement the 'Vote' model in 'models.py'.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
