Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and set up the necessary files and directories. The main files will include `app.py` (the main application file), `models.py` (for database models), `views.py` (for handling HTTP requests), `utils.py` (for utility functions), and `tests.py` (for unit tests). Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up and run the test.", "2. Implement the `models.py` file. This file will contain the data models for the application. We will need a `User` model to represent users, a `URL` model to represent URLs, and a `Click` model to represent clicks on URLs. Each model will be a Python class with attributes representing the fields of the model. The `User` model will have fields like `id`, `username`, `password`, and `urls` (a list of URLs associated with the user). The `URL` model will have fields like `id`, `original_url`, `shortened_url`, `user_id` (the ID of the user who created the URL), `clicks` (a list of clicks on the URL), and `expiration_date`. The `Click` model will have fields like `id`, `url_id` (the ID of the URL that was clicked), `click_time`, and `click_location`. After implementing the models, write a test to ensure that the models are correctly implemented and run the test.", "3. Implement the `utils.py` file. This file will contain utility functions for the application. We will need functions to validate URLs, generate shortened URLs, and gather click data. The `validate_url` function will take a URL as input and return a boolean indicating whether the URL is valid. The `generate_shortened_url` function will take a URL and an optional custom short link as input and return a shortened URL. The `gather_click_data` function will take a click event as input and return a `Click` object with the click time and location. After implementing the utility functions, write a test to ensure that the utility functions are correctly implemented and run the test.", "4. Implement the `views.py` file. This file will handle HTTP requests to the application. We will need views to handle user registration, user login, URL shortening, URL redirection, URL editing, URL deletion, URL analytics viewing, and user account deletion. Each view will be a function that takes a request as input and returns a response. The views will use the models and utility functions to perform their tasks. After implementing the views, write a test to ensure that the views are correctly implemented and run the test.", "5. Implement the `app.py` file. This file will set up the Flask application and register the views. It will import the views from `views.py` and register them with the Flask application. After implementing the application setup, write a test to ensure that the application is correctly set up and run the test.", "6. Implement the `tests.py` file. This file will contain unit tests for the application. We will need tests for each model, each utility function, and each view. The tests will create mock data, call the function or method being tested, and assert that the expected results are returned. After implementing the tests, run them to ensure that all the tests pass.", "7. Implement the admin dashboard. This will be a view in `views.py` that is only accessible to users with admin privileges. The dashboard will display all URLs and user accounts, and allow the admin to delete any URL or user account. After implementing the admin dashboard, write a test to ensure that the dashboard is correctly implemented and run the test.", "8. Implement the URL expiration feature. This will involve adding an `expiration_date` field to the `URL` model, and checking this field in the URL redirection view. If the current date is later than the `expiration_date`, the view will return an error instead of redirecting to the original URL. After implementing the URL expiration feature, write a test to ensure that the feature is correctly implemented and run the test.", "9. Finally, review the entire application to ensure that all requirements have been met. Run all tests again to ensure that they all pass. If any requirements are missing or any tests fail, go back to the relevant step and fix the issue. Once all requirements are met and all tests pass, the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "8. Implement the URL expiration feature. This will involve adding an `expiration_date` field to the `URL` model, and checking this field in the URL redirection view.

No placeholders.\n\nFollow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.\nMake sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.\nWhen writing code if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.\nInclude module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.\n\nUseful to know:\n\nFor Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.\nAlways add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.\nAdd comments explaining very complex bits of logic.\nAlways follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.\nYou can use any package and any other packages you wish to install.\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persis between steps or write operations.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n                                       \nPython toolbelt preferences:\n- pytest\n- dataclasses\n- flask\n\nObjective:```\n### **Online URL Shortening Service**\n\n**Overview**:\nA service that allows users to submit long URLs and then receive a shortened version of that URL for ease of sharing.\n\n**Functional Requirements**:\n\n1. **URL Shortening**:\n   - Users can input a URL to be shortened.\n   - The system should validate that the URL is active and legitimate.\n   - The system should generate a unique shortened URL.\n   - Users can choose custom short links (subject to availability).\n\n2. **Redirection**:\n   - When users or their audience access the shortened URL, they should be redirected to the original URL.\n\n3. **Analytics**:\n   - Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs, including:\n     - Number of clicks.\n     - Date/time of each click.\n     - Geographical location of the clicker.\n\n4. **User Accounts**:\n   - Users can create accounts to manage their URLs.\n   - Account holders can view all their shortened URLs.\n   - Account holders can edit or delete their shortened URLs.\n   - Account holders can view analytics for all their shortened URLs.\n\n5. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - Administrators can view all shortened URLs.\n   - Administrators can delete any URL or user account.\n   - Administrators can monitor system performance and analytics.\n\n6. **Expiration**:\n   - Allow users to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL after which it becomes inactive.\n\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating an extremely detailed step-by-step plan, where each step is long (multiple sentences) and in total includes every single feature requirement specified above, feel free to copy directly from it. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass. Please be sure to include all of the specified feature requirements in the following plan.\n"}], "message_hash": "b157aecd598dba5a9683257d0d703fa407ba17b604f63395e8121ad10d07c2ae"}
