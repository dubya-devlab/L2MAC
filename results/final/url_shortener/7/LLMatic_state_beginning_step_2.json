Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and set up the necessary files and directories. The project structure should include the following files and directories: main.py (the entry point of the application), models.py (for database models), views.py (for handling HTTP requests), services.py (for business logic), tests/ (a directory for test files), and requirements.txt (for project dependencies). Write a basic Flask application in main.py and set up the routes for the application in views.py. Also, set up a mock database in models.py using an in-memory dictionary. Make sure to write tests for each part of the code you write and run them to ensure they pass.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. In models.py, define a URL model with fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, and the user who created it. In services.py, write a function to generate a unique shortened URL. This function should take a URL as input, validate that it is active and legitimate, and then generate a unique shortened URL. If the user chooses a custom short link, the function should check if it is available and use it if it is. Otherwise, it should generate a random unique short link. Write tests for this function and run them to ensure they pass.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. In views.py, set up a route that takes a shortened URL as input and redirects to the original URL. This route should look up the shortened URL in the database, find the corresponding original URL, and then redirect to it. Write tests for this route and run them to ensure they pass.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. In models.py, define a Click model with fields for the URL that was clicked, the date/time of the click, and the geographical location of the clicker. In services.py, write a function to record a click. This function should take a URL as input, create a new Click object, and save it to the database. Also, write a function to retrieve the analytics for a URL. This function should take a URL as input and return a list of all the Click objects for that URL. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they pass.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. In models.py, define a User model with fields for the user's username and password. In services.py, write functions to create a new user, authenticate a user, and retrieve a user's URLs. In views.py, set up routes for user registration, login, and viewing URLs. Write tests for these functions and routes and run them to ensure they pass.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. In services.py, write functions to retrieve all URLs, delete a URL, and delete a user. In views.py, set up routes for viewing all URLs, deleting a URL, and deleting a user. These routes should only be accessible to users with admin privileges. Write tests for these functions and routes and run them to ensure they pass.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. In models.py, add a field to the URL model for the expiration date/time. In services.py, modify the function to generate a shortened URL to also take an expiration date/time as input. In the function to redirect to the original URL, check if the current date/time is past the expiration date/time before redirecting. If it is, return an error message instead of redirecting. Write tests for these modifications and run them to ensure they pass.", "8. Finally, review the entire codebase to ensure that it follows best practices for Python and Flask. Make sure that all functions and routes are properly documented with comments. Run all tests again to ensure that they still pass. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues until all tests pass."], "step": "3. Implement the redirection feature. In views.py, set up a route that takes a shortened URL as input and redirects to the original URL.
