Create a new Python Flask project and install necessary dependencies such as Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended for JWT based authentication, Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM, Flask-Migrate for database migration, and pytest for testing. Create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the dependencies. Write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and all the dependencies are installed correctly.", "2. **Design the database schema:** Design the database schema for the application. The schema should include tables for Users, Posts, Comments, Likes, Retweets, Follows, Messages, Notifications, and Trends. Each table should have appropriate fields based on the requirements. For example, the Users table should have fields for email, username, password, profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Write a test to ensure that the database schema is designed correctly and all the tables and fields exist.", "3. **Implement User Registration and Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. Users should be able to register using email, username, and password. Implement the user authentication feature using JWT. Users should be able to login using their email and password and receive a JWT token. Write a test to ensure that the user registration and authentication features work correctly.", "4. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. Users should be able to edit their profile information including profile picture, bio, website link, and location. They should also have the option to make their profile private or public. Write a test to ensure that the profile management feature works correctly.", "5. **Implement Posting and Content Management:** Implement the feature for creating posts. Users should be able to create text-based posts with a limit of 280 characters and have the option to include images in their posts. They should also be able to delete their own posts. Implement the feature for interacting with posts. Users should be able to like, retweet, and reply to posts. The replies should have a nested comment structure. Implement the content filtering and search feature. Users should be able to search for specific posts or users using keywords and filter posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. Write a test to ensure that the posting and content management features work correctly.", "6. **Implement Social Interaction:** Implement the feature for following and followers. Users should be able to follow and unfollow other users and view posts from followed users in a timeline. They should also receive notifications for new followers. Implement the direct messaging feature. Users should be able to have private conversation threads with other users and have the option to block or unblock users from messaging. Implement the notifications feature. Users should be notified of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions. Write a test to ensure that the social interaction features work correctly.", "7. **Implement Trending and Discovery:** Implement the trending topics feature. The system should identify and display trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. The trending topics should be sortable based on location or globally. Implement the user recommendations feature. The system should recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write a test to ensure that the trending and discovery features work correctly.", "8. **Final Testing and Deployment:** After all the features have been implemented, perform a final round of testing to ensure that all the features work together correctly. Fix any bugs or issues that are found during testing. Once all the tests pass, deploy the application to a suitable hosting platform."], "step": "3. **Implement User Registration and Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature.
