No placeholders.\n\nFollow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.\nMake sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.\nWhen writing code if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.\nInclude module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.\n\nUseful to know:\n\nFor Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.\nAlways add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.\nAdd comments explaining very complex bits of logic.\nAlways follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.\nYou can use any package and any other packages you wish to install.\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persis between steps or write operations.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n                                       \nPython toolbelt preferences:\n- pytest\n- dataclasses\n- flask\n\nObjective:```\n**Online Microblogging Service (OMS) - Description & Requirements**\n\n*Description:*  \nA web-based platform where registered users can post short text-based messages, view messages from others, follow/unfollow other users, and interact with posts. The platform provides features for both individual users and administrative management.\n\n**1.

Posting & Content Management:**\n2.1. **Creating Posts (Tweets):**  \n- Allow users to create text-based posts with a limit of 280 characters.\n- Option to include images posts.\n- Users can delete their own posts.\n\n2.2. **Interacting with Posts:**  \n- Users can like, retweet, and reply to posts.\n- Nested comment structure for post replies.\n\n2.3. **Content Filtering & Search:**  \n- Users can search for specific posts or users using keywords.\n- Filter option based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics.\n\n**3. Social Interaction:**\n3.1. **Following & Followers:**  \n- Users can follow/unfollow other users.\n- A timeline view displays posts from followed users.\n- Users receive notifications for new followers.\n\n3.2. **Direct Messaging:**  \n- Private conversation threads between users.\n- Option to block/unblock users from messaging.\n\n3.3. **Notifications:**  \n- Users are notified of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions.\n\n**4. Trending & Discovery:**\n4.1. **Trending Topics:**  \n- System identifies and displays trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions.\n- Trending topics can be sorted based on location or globally.\n\n4.2. **User Recommendations:**  \n- Recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers.\n\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating an extremely detailed step-by-step plan, where each step is long (multiple sentences) and in total includes every single feature requirement specified above, feel free to copy directly from it. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass. Please be sure to include all of the specified feature requirements in the following plan.\n"}], "message_hash": "b157aecd598dba5a9683257d0d703fa407ba17b604f63395e8121ad10d07c2ae"}
