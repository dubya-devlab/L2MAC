The 'controllers' directory will contain the business logic for handling requests and responses. The 'views' directory will contain the code for rendering the user interface. The 'tests' directory will contain all the test cases. The 'utils' directory will contain utility functions and classes. Also, create a file named 'app.py' in the root directory which will serve as the entry point of the application. Finally, create a 'requirements.txt' file in the root directory to list all the Python package dependencies. Write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up.", "2. Define the User model. In the 'models' directory, create a file named 'user.py'. This file will contain a class named 'User' with attributes for id, name, email, password, profile picture, and storage used. The id will be a unique identifier for each user. The name, email, and password will be used for registration and login. The profile picture will be a URL to the user's profile picture. The storage used will be a number representing the amount of storage used by the user in bytes. Write tests to ensure that the User model is correctly defined.", "3. Implement the user registration functionality. In the 'controllers' directory, create a file named 'user_controller.py'. This file will contain a function named 'register_user' which takes a name, email, and password as input, creates a new User instance, and stores it in a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). The function should also handle cases where the email is already registered. Write tests to ensure that the user registration functionality works correctly.", "4. Implement the user login functionality. In the 'user_controller.py' file, add a function named 'login_user' which takes an email and password as input, checks if a User with the given email and password exists in the mock database, and returns the User instance if it exists. The function should also handle cases where the email is not registered or the password is incorrect. Write tests to ensure that the user login functionality works correctly.", "5. Implement the forgot password functionality. In the 'user_controller.py' file, add a function named 'forgot_password' which takes an email as input, checks if a User with the given email exists in the mock database, and returns a password reset link if it exists. The function should also handle cases where the email is not registered. Write tests to ensure that the forgot password functionality works correctly.", "6. Implement the user profile functionality. In the 'user_controller.py' file, add a function named 'get_user_profile' which takes a User instance as input and returns the user's profile information (name, email, profile picture, and storage used). Write tests to ensure that the user profile functionality works correctly.", "7. Define the File and Folder models. In the 'models' directory, create files named 'file.py' and 'folder.py'. The 'file.py' file will contain a class named 'File' with attributes for id, name, size, type, parent folder, and version history. The 'folder.py' file will contain a class named 'Folder' with attributes for id, name, and parent folder. Write tests to ensure that the File and Folder models are correctly defined.", "8. Implement the file upload functionality. In the 'controllers' directory, create a file named 'file_controller.py'. This file will contain a function named 'upload_file' which takes a file, a User instance, and a Folder instance as input, creates a new File instance, and stores it in the mock database. The function should also update the user's storage used. Write tests to ensure that the file upload functionality works correctly.", "9. Implement the file download functionality. In the 'file_controller.py' file, add a function named 'download_file' which takes a File instance as input and returns the file. Write tests to ensure that the file download functionality works correctly.", "10. Implement the file/folder organization functionality. In the 'file_controller.py' file, add functions named 'create_folder', 'rename_file_folder', 'move_file_folder', and 'delete_file_folder'. The 'create_folder' function should take a name and a Folder instance as input, create a new Folder instance, and store it in the mock database. The 'rename_file_folder' function should take a File or Folder instance and a new name as input, and rename the File or Folder. The 'move_file_folder' function should take a File or Folder instance and a Folder instance as input, and move the File or Folder to the new Folder. The 'delete_file_folder' function should take a File or Folder instance as input, and delete it from the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the file/folder organization functionality works correctly.", "11. Implement the file versioning functionality. In the 'file_controller.py' file, add a function named 'restore_file_version' which takes a File instance and a version number as input, and restores the File to the given version. Write tests to ensure that the file versioning functionality works correctly.", "12. Define the SharedLink model. In the 'models' directory, create a file named 'shared_link.py'. This file will contain a class named 'SharedLink' with attributes for id, file or folder, expiry date, and password. Write tests to ensure that the SharedLink model is correctly defined.", "13. Implement the file sharing functionality. In the 'controllers' directory, create a file named 'share_controller.py'. This file will contain a function named 'create_shared_link' which takes a File or Folder instance, an expiry date, and a password as input, creates a new SharedLink instance, and stores it in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the file sharing functionality works correctly.", "14. Implement the shared folders functionality. In the 'share_controller.py' file, add a function named 'invite_user_to_folder' which takes a Folder instance, a User instance, and permissions as input, and adds the User to the Folder with the given permissions. Write tests to ensure that the shared folders functionality works correctly.", "15. Implement the activity log functionality. In the 'controllers' directory, create a file named 'log_controller.py'. This file will contain a function named 'log_activity' which takes a User instance and an activity as input, and logs the activity. Write tests to ensure that the activity log functionality works correctly.", "16. Implement the user interface. In the 'views' directory, create files named 'register.html', 'login.html', 'profile.html', 'upload.html', 'download.html', 'organize.html', 'version.html', 'share.html', 'invite.html', and 'log.html'. Each file will contain the HTML code for the corresponding page. Write tests to ensure that the user interface is correctly implemented.", "17. Implement the Flask application. In the 'app.py' file, import Flask and define the routes for registration, login, profile, upload, download, organize, version, share, invite, and log. Each route should call the corresponding function in the controllers and render the corresponding page in the views. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application works correctly."], "step": "14.
