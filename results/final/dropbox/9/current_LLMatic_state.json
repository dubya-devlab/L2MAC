Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new directory named 'cloudsafe'. Inside this directory, create two subdirectories: 'app' and 'tests'. The 'app' directory will contain the application code, while the 'tests' directory will contain the test cases. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file at the root of the project to manage the project dependencies. The dependencies will include Flask for the web framework, pytest for testing, and itsdangerous for generating secure tokens for password reset functionality. After setting up the project structure and the 'requirements.txt' file, write tests to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and that the 'requirements.txt' file contains the correct dependencies.", "2. Next, create the User data model. This model will represent the users of the application. It will have fields for id, name, email, password, profile picture, and storage used. The id will be a unique identifier for each user, the name, email, and password will be used for registration and login, the profile picture will be used in the user's profile, and the storage used will keep track of how much storage the user has used. Implement this model as a Python class in a new file 'models.py' in the 'app' directory. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that the model is correctly defined and that it behaves as expected.", "3. Implement the user registration functionality. This will involve creating a new route '/register' that handles POST requests. The route handler should validate the incoming data, create a new User instance, and store it in the in-memory database. If the registration is successful, the handler should return a success message and a 201 status code. If the registration fails (e.g., due to invalid data or a duplicate email), the handler should return an error message and an appropriate status code. Implement this functionality in a new file 'routes.py' in the 'app' directory. After implementing the user registration functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "4. Implement the user login functionality. This will involve creating a new route '/login' that handles POST requests. The route handler should validate the incoming data, check the user's credentials against the stored User instances, and return a success message and a 200 status code if the credentials are correct. If the credentials are incorrect, the handler should return an error message and a 401 status code. Implement this functionality in the 'routes.py' file. After implementing the user login functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "5. Implement the forgot password functionality. This will involve creating a new route '/forgot-password' that handles POST requests. The route handler should validate the incoming data, generate a secure token, and send an email to the user with a link to reset their password. The link should include the secure token as a query parameter. Implement this functionality in the 'routes.py' file. After implementing the forgot password functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "6. Implement the user profile functionality. This will involve creating a new route '/profile' that handles GET requests. The route handler should return the profile information of the currently logged-in user. The profile information should include the user's profile picture, name, email, and storage used. Implement this functionality in the 'routes.py' file. After implementing the user profile functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "7. Implement the change password functionality. This will involve creating a new route '/change-password' that handles POST requests. The route handler should validate the incoming data, update the user's password, and return a success message and a 200 status code. If the password update fails (e.g., due to invalid data), the handler should return an error message and an appropriate status code. Implement this functionality in the 'routes.py' file. After implementing the change password functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "8. Implement the file upload functionality. This will involve creating a new route '/upload' that handles POST requests. The route handler should validate the incoming data, create a new File instance, and store it in the in-memory database. If the file upload is successful, the handler should return a success message and a 201 status code. If the file upload fails (e.g., due to invalid data or a file size/type restriction), the handler should return an error message and an appropriate status code. Implement this functionality in a new file 'file_routes.py' in the 'app' directory. After implementing the file upload functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "9. Implement the file download functionality. This will involve creating a new route '/download' that handles GET requests. The route handler should validate the incoming data, retrieve the requested File instance from the in-memory database, and return it as a response. If the file download is successful, the handler should return a success message and a 200 status code. If the file download fails (e.g., due to the file not being found), the handler should return an error message and an appropriate status code. Implement this functionality in the 'file_routes.py' file. After implementing the file download functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "10. Implement the file organization functionality. This will involve creating new routes '/create-folder', '/rename', '/move', and '/delete' that handle POST requests. The route handlers should validate the incoming data, perform the requested operation (creating a folder, renaming a file/folder, moving a file/folder, or deleting a file/folder), and return a success message and a 200 status code. If the operation fails (e.g., due to invalid data or a file/folder not being found), the handlers should return an error message and an appropriate status code. Implement this functionality in the 'file_routes.py' file. After implementing the file organization functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "11. Implement the file versioning functionality. This will involve modifying the File model to include a versions field, which will be a list of File instances representing previous versions of the file. The file upload route handler should be modified to create a new version of a file if a file with the same name already exists. The file download route handler should be modified to accept an optional version parameter and return the requested version of the file. Implement this functionality in the 'models.py' and 'file_routes.py' files. After implementing the file versioning functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "12. Implement the file sharing functionality. This will involve creating new routes '/share-link' and '/share-folder' that handle POST requests. The '/share-link' route handler should generate a shareable URL link for a file/folder and return it in the response. The '/share-folder' route handler should invite a user to a shared folder and set their permissions. Implement this functionality in a new file 'share_routes.py' in the 'app' directory. After implementing the file sharing functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "13. Implement the activity log functionality. This will involve creating a new Activity model and a new route '/activity' that handles GET requests. The route handler should return a list of the currently logged-in user's activities. Each activity should include the action (e.g., 'uploaded', 'downloaded', 'shared'), the target (e.g., the file or folder), and the timestamp. Implement this functionality in the 'models.py' and 'routes.py' files. After implementing the activity log functionality, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "14. Finally, implement the UI/UX requirements. This will involve creating HTML templates for the various pages of the application (e.g., the registration page, the login page, the profile page, the file upload page, the file download page, the file organization page, the file versioning page, the file sharing page, and the activity log page). The templates should be responsive and support both light and dark modes. They should also include previews for images, videos, and common document types. Implement this functionality in a new 'templates' directory in the 'app' directory. After implementing the UI/UX requirements, write tests to ensure that the templates render correctly and that they behave as expected."], "step": "14. Finally, implement the UI/UX requirements.

Finally, implement the UI/UX requirements. This will involve creating HTML templates for the various pages of the application (e.g., the registration page, the login page, the profile page, the file upload page, the file download page, the file organization page, the file versioning page, the file sharing page, and the activity log page). The templates should be responsive and support both light and dark modes. They should also include previews for images, videos, and common document types. Implement this functionality in a new 'templates' directory in the 'app' directory. After implementing the UI/UX requirements, write tests to ensure that the templates render correctly and that they behave as expected.\n``` \n\n If yes, call the function `sub_task_step_complete`, otherwise reflect and correct the full code to complete the task.
