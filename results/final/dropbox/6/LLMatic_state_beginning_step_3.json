Write tests to ensure that the file organization functionality is working correctly.", "12. Implement the file versioning functionality. This will involve modifying the File model to include a versions field, which will be a list of File objects representing previous versions of the file. The file upload functionality will be modified to create a new File object for each version of a file, add the new File object to the versions list of the original File object, and save the original File object to the database. The file download functionality will be modified to accept an optional query parameter containing the version number, retrieve the corresponding File object from the versions list, and return the file. Write tests to ensure that the file versioning functionality is working correctly.", "13. Implement the file sharing functionality. This will involve creating new routes in the Flask application that handle POST requests to '/share-link' and '/share-folder'.

No placeholders.\n\nFollow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.\nMake sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.\nWhen writing code if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.\nInclude module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.\n\nUseful to know:\n\nFor Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.\nAlways add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.\nAdd comments explaining very complex bits of logic.\nAlways follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.\nYou can use any package and any other packages you wish to install.\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persis between steps or write operations.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n                                       \nPython toolbelt preferences:\n- pytest\n- dataclasses\n- flask\n\nObjective:```\n**1.

Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass. Please be sure to include all of the specified feature requirements in the following plan.\n"}], "message_hash": "b157aecd598dba5a9683257d0d703fa407ba17b604f63395e8121ad10d07c2ae"}
