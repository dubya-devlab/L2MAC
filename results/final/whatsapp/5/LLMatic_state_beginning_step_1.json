This class should have attributes for `user` (an instance of the `User` class), `blocked_contacts` (a list of `User` instances), and `groups` (a list of `Group` instances). Implement methods for `block_contact`, `unblock_contact`, `create_group`, `edit_group`, and `delete_group`. The `block_contact` method should add a user to the `blocked_contacts` list, the `unblock_contact` method should remove a user from the `blocked_contacts` list, the `create_group` method should create a new group and add it to the `groups` list, the `edit_group` method should update a group in the `groups` list, and the `delete_group` method should remove a group from the `groups` list.
