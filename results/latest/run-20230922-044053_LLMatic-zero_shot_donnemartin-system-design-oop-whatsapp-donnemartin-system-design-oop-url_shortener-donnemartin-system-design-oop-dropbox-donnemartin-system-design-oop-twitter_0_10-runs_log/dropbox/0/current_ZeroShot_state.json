You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\n\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\n\nWhen modifying code and including new code, you must use the diff format using the line numbers.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nIf you are unsure, you can list all available files to view with the `list_files` function.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou can write to local files, however you cannot use any databases, as none are setup in the local environment.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nYou will get instructions for code to write.\nYou will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.\n\nThink step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.\nFirst lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.\n\nDo not comment on what every file does.

Try to solve the problem in the minimal steps necessary. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test.\n"}], "base_dialog": [], "sub_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"requirements.txt\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"flask\\nflask_sqlalchemy\\nflask_login\\nflask_wtf\\nflask_bcrypt\\nflask_mail\\nwerkzeug\\nitsdangerous\\nsqlalchemy\\npytest\\npytest-flask\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.\"}"}]}
