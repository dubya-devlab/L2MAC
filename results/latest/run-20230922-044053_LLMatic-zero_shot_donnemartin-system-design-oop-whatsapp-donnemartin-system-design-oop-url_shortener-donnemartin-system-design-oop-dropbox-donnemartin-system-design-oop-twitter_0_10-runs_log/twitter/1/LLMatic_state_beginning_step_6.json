Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python project and set up the necessary directories and files. The project will be structured as follows: a main.py file as the entry point of the application, a models directory for the data models, a services directory for the business logic, a routes directory for the HTTP routes, and a tests directory for the unit tests. Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage the Python dependencies. The dependencies will include Flask for the web framework, SQLAlchemy for the ORM, PyJWT for JWT authentication, and pytest for testing. Write the necessary code to initialize the Flask application in the main.py file and run tests to ensure that the application starts up correctly.\",\n    \n    \"2. Define the data models. The application will need several data models to represent the different entities in the system. These include User for the registered users, Post for the user posts, Comment for the post comments, Like for the post likes, Follow for the user follows, Message for the direct messages, and Notification for the user notifications. Each model will have the necessary fields as per the requirements. For example, the User model will have fields for email, username, password, profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Write the necessary SQLAlchemy code to define these models and run tests to ensure that the models are defined correctly and can be persisted to the database.\",\n    \n    \"3. Implement the user registration and authentication functionality. This will involve creating a new User record in the database when a user registers, and generating a JWT token when a user logs in. The token will be used to authenticate subsequent requests from the user. Write the necessary code in a UserService class in the services directory, and expose the functionality through /register and /login routes in the routes directory. Run tests to ensure that the registration and login functionality works as expected, and that the JWT token is generated correctly.\",\n    \n    \"4. Implement the profile management functionality. This will involve allowing users to update their User record with new profile information, and toggling their profile visibility between private and public. Write the necessary code in the UserService class, and expose the functionality through a /profile route. Run tests to ensure that the profile management functionality works as expected.\",\n    \n    \"5. Implement the post creation and deletion functionality. This will involve creating a new Post record in the database when a user creates a post, and deleting a Post record when a user deletes a post. Write the necessary code in a PostService class in the services directory, and expose the functionality through /posts and /posts/<id> routes. Run tests to ensure that the post creation and deletion functionality works as expected.\",\n    \n    \"6. Implement the post interaction functionality. This will involve creating new Like, Comment, and Retweet records in the database when a user interacts with a post. Write the necessary code in the PostService class, and expose the functionality through /posts/<id>/like, /posts/<id>/comment, and /posts/<id>/retweet routes. Run tests to ensure that the post interaction functionality works as expected.\",\n    \n    \"7. Implement the content filtering and search functionality. This will involve querying the Post records in the database based on keywords, hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. Write the necessary code in the PostService class, and expose the functionality through a /search route. Run tests to ensure that the content filtering and search functionality works as expected.\",\n    \n    \"8. Implement the following and followers functionality. This will involve creating new Follow records in the database when a user follows or unfollows another user, and querying the Post records from followed users for the timeline view. Write the necessary code in a UserService class, and expose the functionality through /follow and /timeline routes. Run tests to ensure that the following and followers functionality works as expected.\",\n    \n    \"9. Implement the direct messaging functionality. This will involve creating new Message records in the database when a user sends a message to another user, and querying the Message records for the conversation view. Write the necessary code in a MessageService class in the services directory, and expose the functionality through /messages and /messages/<id> routes. Run tests to ensure that the direct messaging functionality works as expected.\",\n    \n    \"10. Implement the notifications functionality. This will involve creating new Notification records in the database when a user receives a like, retweet, reply, or mention, and querying the Notification records for the notifications view. Write the necessary code in a NotificationService class in the services directory, and expose the functionality through a /notifications route. Run tests to ensure that the notifications functionality works as expected.\",\n    \n    \"11. Implement the trending topics functionality. This will involve identifying the most frequently mentioned hashtags or topics in the Post records, and displaying them in a trending view. Write the necessary code in a TrendingService class in the services directory, and expose the functionality through a /trending route. Run tests to ensure that the trending topics functionality works as expected.\",\n    \n    \"12. Implement the user recommendations functionality. This will involve recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write the necessary code in a RecommendationService class in the services directory, and expose the functionality through a /recommendations route. Run tests to ensure that the user recommendations functionality works as expected.\",\n    \n    \"13. Finally, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application. This will involve writing unit tests for all the services and routes, and running them using pytest. Ensure that all the tests pass and that the application meets all the requirements as specified in the problem statement.\"\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}], "file_dict": {"main.py": ["from flask import
