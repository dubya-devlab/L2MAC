Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python project and set up the necessary directories and files. The project will be structured as follows: a main.py file as the entry point of the application, a models directory for the data models, a services directory for the business logic, a routes directory for the HTTP routes, and a tests directory for the unit tests. Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage the Python dependencies. The dependencies will include Flask for the web framework, SQLAlchemy for the ORM, PyJWT for JWT authentication, and pytest for testing. Write the necessary code to initialize the Flask application in the main.py file and run tests to ensure that the application starts up correctly.\",\n    \n    \"2. Define the data models. The application will need several data models to represent the different entities in the system. These include User for the registered users, Post for the user posts, Comment for the post comments, Like for the post likes, Follow for the user follows, Message for the direct messages, and Notification for the user notifications. Each model will have the necessary fields as per the requirements. For example, the User model will have fields for email, username, password, profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Write the necessary SQLAlchemy code to define these models and run tests to ensure that the models are defined correctly and can be persisted to the database.\",\n    \n    \"3.
