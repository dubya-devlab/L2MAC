Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new directory for the project and initialize it as a Python project. Create subdirectories for the different components of the project: 'models', 'controllers', 'views', 'tests', and 'utils'. In the root directory, create a 'main.py' file which will serve as the entry point for the application. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list all the Python packages that will be needed for the project. Some of the packages that will be needed include Flask (for building the web application), SQLAlchemy (for ORM), PyJWT (for JWT authentication), pytest (for testing), and Pillow (for image processing).\",\n\n    \"2. Define the data models for the application. In the 'models' directory, create Python files for each of the following models: 'user.py', 'post.py', 'comment.py', 'like.py', 'follow.py', 'message.py', 'notification.py', and 'trend.py'. Each of these files will define a class that represents a table in the database. For example, the 'user.py' file will define a User class with attributes such as id, email, username, password, profile_picture, bio, website_link, location, and is_private. The 'post.py' file will define a Post class with attributes such as id, user_id, text, image, and timestamp. The 'comment.py' file will define a Comment class with attributes such as id, user_id, post_id, text, and timestamp. The 'like.py' file will define a Like class with attributes such as id, user_id, and post_id. The 'follow.py' file will define a Follow class with attributes such as follower_id and followee_id. The 'message.py' file will define a Message class with attributes such as id, sender_id, receiver_id, text, and timestamp. The 'notification.py' file will define a Notification class with attributes such as id, user_id, type, and related_id.

Each of these files will define a class that contains methods for handling the different operations related to the corresponding model. For example, the 'user_controller.py' file will define a UserController class with methods such as register, login, reset_password, edit_profile, and toggle_privacy. The 'post_controller.py' file will define a PostController class with methods such as create_post, delete_post, and search_posts. The 'comment_controller.py' file will define a CommentController class with methods such as create_comment and delete_comment. The 'like_controller.py' file will define a LikeController class with methods such as like_post and unlike_post. The 'follow_controller.py' file will define a FollowController class with methods such as follow_user and unfollow_user.

Each of these files will define a class that contains methods for rendering the corresponding views. For example, the 'user_view.py' file will define a UserView class with methods such as register, login, reset_password, edit_profile, and toggle_privacy. The 'post_view.py' file will define a PostView class with methods such as create_post, delete_post, and search_posts. The 'comment_view.py' file will define a CommentView class with methods such as create_comment and delete_comment. The 'like_view.py' file will define a LikeView class with methods such as like_post and unlike_post. The 'follow_view.py' file will define a FollowView class with methods such as follow_user and unfollow_user. The 'message_view.py' file will define a MessageView class with methods such as send_message, receive_messages, and block_user. The 'notification_view.py' file will define a NotificationView class with methods such as get_notifications and mark_as_read.

After implementing these classes, write tests to ensure that the views render correctly and the user interactions are handled properly.\",\n\n    \"5. Implement the main application. In the 'main.py' file, import the Flask module and create an instance of the Flask class. Also, import the views and register them with the Flask application. Set up the routes for the different views and the corresponding HTTP methods. For example, the route for the register view might be '/register' and the corresponding HTTP method might be 'POST'. The route for the login view might be '/login' and the corresponding HTTP method might be 'POST'. The route for the reset_password view might be '/reset_password' and the corresponding HTTP method might be 'POST'.

The route for the get_notifications view might be '/get_notifications' and the corresponding HTTP method might be 'GET'. The route for the mark_as_read view might be '/mark_as_read' and the corresponding HTTP method might be 'POST'. The route for the get_trending_hashtags view might be '/get_trending_hashtags' and the corresponding HTTP method might be 'GET'. The route for the get_user_recommendations view might be '/get_user_recommendations' and the corresponding HTTP method might be 'GET'. After setting up the routes, write tests to ensure that the routes work as expected and the HTTP methods are handled properly.\",\n\n    \"6. Implement the utility functions for the application. In the 'utils' directory, create Python files for each of the following utilities: 'auth.py', 'image.py', 'search.py', 'trend.py', and 'recommend.py'. The 'auth.py' file will define functions for handling authentication, such as generating and verifying JWT tokens.

The 'trend.py' file will define functions for identifying trending hashtags and topics. The 'recommend.py' file will define functions for recommending users to follow. After implementing these utilities, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.\",\n\n    \"7. Finally, run the application and perform end-to-end testing. Use the pytest module to run all the tests that have been written. Ensure that all the tests pass. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues. Once all the tests pass, the application is ready for deployment.\"\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nObjective: Execute task step: 2.

Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new directory for the project and initialize it as a Python project. Create subdirectories for the different components of the project: 'models', 'controllers', 'views', 'tests', and 'utils'. In the root directory, create a 'main.py' file which will serve as the entry point for the application. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list all the Python packages that will be needed for the project. Some of the packages that will be needed include Flask (for building the web application), SQLAlchemy (for ORM), PyJWT (for JWT authentication), pytest (for testing), and Pillow (for image processing).\",\n\n    \"2.
