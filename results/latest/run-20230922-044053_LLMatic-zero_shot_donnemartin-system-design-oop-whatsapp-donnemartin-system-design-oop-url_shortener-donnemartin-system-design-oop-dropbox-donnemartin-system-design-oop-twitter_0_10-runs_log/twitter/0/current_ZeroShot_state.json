You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\n\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\n\nWhen modifying code and including new code, you must use the diff format using the line numbers.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nIf you are unsure, you can list all available files to view with the `list_files` function.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou can write to local files, however you cannot use any databases, as none are setup in the local environment.\n\nUse the functions provided.

The platform provides features for both individual users and administrative management.\n\n**1. User Management:**\n1.1. **Registration & Authentication:**  \n- Allow users to register using email, username, and password.\n- Option to reset forgotten passwords.\n- Secure authentication using JWT or similar protocols.\n\n1.2. **Profile Management:**  \n- Users can edit their profile information: profile picture, bio, website link, and location.\n- Option to make profile private or public.\n\n**2. Posting & Content Management:**\n2.1. **Creating Posts (Tweets):**  \n- Allow users to create text-based posts with a limit of 280 characters.\n- Option to include images posts.\n- Users can delete their own posts.\n\n2.2. **Interacting with Posts:**  \n- Users can like, retweet, and reply to posts.\n- Nested comment structure for post replies.\n\n2.3. **Content Filtering & Search:**  \n- Users can search for specific posts or users using keywords.\n- Filter option based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics.\n\n**3. Social Interaction:**\n3.1. **Following & Followers:**  \n- Users can follow/unfollow other users.\n- A timeline view displays posts from followed users.\n- Users receive notifications for new followers.\n\n3.2. **Direct Messaging:**  \n- Private conversation threads between users.\n- Option to block/unblock users from messaging.\n\n3.3. **Notifications:**  \n- Users are notified of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions.\n\n**4. Trending & Discovery:**\n4.1. **Trending Topics:**  \n- System identifies and displays trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions.\n- Trending topics can be sorted based on location or globally.\n\n4.2. **User Recommendations:**  \n- Recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers.\n\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating a detailed step-by-step plan. Try to solve the problem in the minimal steps necessary. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test.\n"}], "base_dialog": [], "sub_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"requirements.txt\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"flask\\nflask_sqlalchemy\\nflask_jwt_extended\\nflask_bcrypt\\nflask_marshmallow\\nmarshmallow-sqlalchemy\\nflask_cors\\npytest\\npytest-flask\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.\"}"}]}
