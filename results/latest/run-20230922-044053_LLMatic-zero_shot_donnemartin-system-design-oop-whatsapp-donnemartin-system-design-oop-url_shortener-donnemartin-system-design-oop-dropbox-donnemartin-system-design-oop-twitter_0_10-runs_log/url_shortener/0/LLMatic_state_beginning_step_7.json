Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python project and set up the necessary directories and files. The project will have the following structure: \\n- `main.py`: This will be the entry point of the application. \\n- `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python packages that the project depends on. \\n- `url_shortener/`: This directory will contain the core logic of the URL shortening service. It will have the following files: \\n  - `models.py`: This file will define the data models for the application, such as User, URL, and Click. \\n  - `shortener.py`: This file will contain the logic for shortening URLs and generating unique short codes. \\n  - `validator.py`: This file will contain the logic for validating URLs. \\n  - `analytics.py`: This file will contain the logic for tracking and reporting URL click analytics. \\n  - `user_management.py`: This file will contain the logic for user account management. \\n  - `admin.py`: This file will contain the logic for the admin dashboard. \\n- `tests/`: This directory will contain all the test cases for the application. Each file in the `url_shortener/` directory will have a corresponding test file in this directory. \\n\\nAfter setting up the project structure, write a test case in `tests/test_shortener.py` to test the URL shortening functionality. The test case should create a URL, shorten it, and then assert that the shortened URL is not the same as the original URL and that it redirects to the original URL.\",\n\n    \"2. Implement the URL shortening functionality. In `url_shortener/models.py`, define a URL data model with fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who created it, and the creation and expiration dates. In `url_shortener/shortener.py`, implement a function to generate a unique short code for each URL. This function should take a URL as input and return a unique short code. Then, implement a function to create a shortened URL using the short code. This function should take a URL and a user as input, generate a short code, create a URL object with the original URL and the shortened URL, and return the URL object. Write a test case in `tests/test_shortener.py` to test this functionality. The test case should create a URL, shorten it, and then assert that the shortened URL is not the same as the original URL and that it redirects to the original URL.\",\n\n    \"3. Implement the URL validation functionality. In `url_shortener/validator.py`, implement a function to validate URLs. This function should take a URL as input and return a boolean indicating whether the URL is valid or not. A valid URL is one that is active and legitimate. Write a test case in `tests/test_validator.py` to test this functionality. The test case should test the URL validation function with both valid and invalid URLs and assert that the function returns the correct result in each case.\",\n\n    \"4. Implement the URL redirection functionality. In `main.py`, implement a function to handle requests to shortened URLs. This function should take a short code as input, look up the corresponding URL in the database, and redirect to the original URL. Write a test case in `tests/test_main.py` to test this functionality. The test case should create a URL, shorten it, make a request to the shortened URL, and then assert that the response is a redirect to the original URL.\",\n\n    \"5. Implement the click tracking functionality. In `url_shortener/models.py`, define a Click data model with fields for the URL, the date and time of the click, and the geographical location of the clicker. In `main.py`, update the URL redirection function to create a Click object each time a shortened URL is accessed. Write a test case in `tests/test_main.py` to test this functionality. The test case should create a URL, shorten it, make a request to the shortened URL, and then assert that a Click object was created with the correct URL and date/time.\",\n\n    \"6. Implement the URL analytics functionality. In `url_shortener/analytics.py`, implement a function to retrieve the click analytics for a URL. This function should take a URL as input and return a list of Click objects associated with that URL. Write a test case in `tests/test_analytics.py` to test this functionality. The test case should create a URL, generate some clicks for it, and then assert that the analytics function returns the correct click data.\",\n\n    \"7. Implement the user account management functionality. In `url_shortener/models.py`, define a User data model with fields for the user's username and password. In `url_shortener/user_management.py`, implement functions to create, edit, and delete user accounts, and to retrieve a user's URLs. Write test cases in `tests/test_user_management.py` to test this functionality. The test cases should test the creation, editing, and deletion of user accounts, and the retrieval of a user's URLs.\",\n\n    \"8. Implement the admin dashboard functionality. In `url_shortener/admin.py`, implement functions to view all URLs and user accounts, and to delete any URL or user account. Write test cases in `tests/test_admin.py` to test this functionality. The test cases should test the viewing and deletion of URLs and user accounts.\",\n\n    \"9. Implement the URL expiration functionality. In `url_shortener/shortener.py`, update the URL creation function to accept an optional expiration date/time. In `main.py`, update the URL redirection function to check the expiration date/time of the URL and return a 404 response if the URL has expired. Write test cases in `tests/test_shortener.py` and `tests/test_main.py` to test this functionality. The test cases should test the creation of URLs with an expiration date/time and the redirection to expired URLs.\",\n\n    \"10.

Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python project and set up the necessary directories and files. The project will have the following structure: \\n- `main.py`: This will be the entry point of the application. \\n- `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python packages that the project depends on. \\n- `url_shortener/`: This directory will contain the core logic of the URL shortening service. It will have the following files: \\n  - `models.py`: This file will define the data models for the application, such as User, URL, and Click. \\n  - `shortener.py`: This file will contain the logic for shortening URLs and generating unique short codes. \\n  - `validator.py`: This file will contain the logic for validating URLs. \\n  - `analytics.py`: This file will contain the logic for tracking and reporting URL click analytics. \\n  - `user_management.py`: This file will contain the logic for user account management. \\n  - `admin.py`: This file will contain the logic for the admin dashboard. \\n- `tests/`: This directory will contain all the test cases for the application. Each file in the `url_shortener/` directory will have a corresponding test file in this directory. \\n\\nAfter setting up the project structure, write a test case in `tests/test_shortener.py` to test the URL shortening functionality. The test case should create a URL, shorten it, and then assert that the shortened URL is not the same as the original URL and that it redirects to the original URL.\",\n\n    \"2. Implement the URL shortening functionality. In `url_shortener/models.py`, define a URL data model with fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who created it, and the creation and expiration dates. In `url_shortener/shortener.py`, implement a function to generate a unique short code for each URL. This function should take a URL as input and return a unique short code. Then, implement a function to create a shortened URL using the short code. This function should take a URL and a user as input, generate a short code, create a URL object with the original URL and the shortened URL, and return the URL object. Write a test case in `tests/test_shortener.py` to test this functionality. The test case should create a URL, shorten it, and then assert that the shortened URL is not the same as the original URL and that it redirects to the original URL.\",\n\n    \"3. Implement the URL validation functionality. In `url_shortener/validator.py`, implement a function to validate URLs. This function should take a URL as input and return a boolean indicating whether the URL is valid or not. A valid URL is one that is active and legitimate. Write a test case in `tests/test_validator.py` to test this functionality. The test case should test the URL validation function with both valid and invalid URLs and assert that the function returns the correct result in each case.\",\n\n    \"4. Implement the URL redirection functionality. In `main.py`, implement a function to handle requests to shortened URLs. This function should take a short code as input, look up the corresponding URL in the database, and redirect to the original URL. Write a test case in `tests/test_main.py` to test this functionality. The test case should create a URL, shorten it, make a request to the shortened URL, and then assert that the response is a redirect to the original URL.\",\n\n    \"5. Implement the click tracking functionality. In `url_shortener/models.py`, define a Click data model with fields for the URL, the date and time of the click, and the geographical location of the clicker. In `main.py`, update the URL redirection function to create a Click object each time a shortened URL is accessed. Write a test case in `tests/test_main.py` to test this functionality. The test case should create a URL, shorten it, make a request to the shortened URL, and then assert that a Click object was created with the correct URL and date/time.\",\n\n    \"6. Implement the URL analytics functionality. In `url_shortener/analytics.py`, implement a function to retrieve the click analytics for a URL. This function should take a URL as input and return a list of Click objects associated with that URL. Write a test case in `tests/test_analytics.py` to test this functionality. The test case should create a URL, generate some clicks for it, and then assert that the analytics function returns the correct click data.\",\n\n    \"7.

In `url_shortener/user_management.py`, implement functions to create, edit, and delete user accounts, and to retrieve a user's URLs. Write test cases in `tests/test_user_management.py` to test this functionality. The test cases should test the creation, editing, and deletion of user accounts, and the retrieval of a user's URLs.\",\n\n    \"8. Implement the admin dashboard functionality. In `url_shortener/admin.py`, implement functions to view all URLs and user accounts, and to delete any URL or user account. Write test cases in `tests/test_admin.py` to test this functionality. The test cases should test the viewing and deletion of URLs and user accounts.\",\n\n    \"9. Implement the URL expiration functionality. In `url_shortener/shortener.py`, update the URL creation function to accept an optional expiration date/time. In `main.py`, update the URL redirection function to check the expiration date/time of the URL and return a 404 response if the URL has expired. Write test cases in `tests/test_shortener.py` and `tests/test_main.py` to test this functionality. The test cases should test the creation of URLs with an expiration date/time and the redirection to expired URLs.\",\n\n    \"10.
