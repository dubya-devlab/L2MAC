Create a new Python project and initialize it with a `requirements.txt` file. This file will list all the Python packages that are required for the project. Some of the packages that will be needed include Flask (for creating the web application), Flask-SocketIO (for real-time communication), Flask-SQLAlchemy (for database operations), Flask-Login (for user authentication), Flask-WTF (for form handling), and Pillow (for image processing). Create a `main.py` file which will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `config.py` file for storing configuration variables such as the secret key and database URI. Write tests to ensure that the project setup is correct and all the required packages are installed.\",\n\n    \"2. **User Registration and Authentication**: Create a `models.py` file and define a `User` class in it. This class will represent the users of the chat application and will have fields such as `id`, `email`, `password`, `profile_picture`, `status_message`, `last_seen`, and `privacy_settings`. The `User` class should also have methods for setting and checking passwords. Next, create a `forms.py` file and define a `RegistrationForm` and a `LoginForm` in it. These forms will be used for user registration and login respectively. The `RegistrationForm` should have fields for email and password, and the `LoginForm` should have fields for email and password. Write tests to ensure that user registration and authentication are working correctly.\",\n\n    \"3. **User Profile**: Add methods to the `User` class for setting and getting the profile picture and status message. Also, add a method for updating the privacy settings. Write tests to ensure that these methods are working correctly.\",\n\n    \"4. **Contact Management**: Define a `Contact` class in the `models.py` file. This class will represent the contacts of a user and will have fields such as `id`, `user_id`, `contact_id`, and `blocked`. The `user_id` and `contact_id` fields will be foreign keys referencing the `id` field of the `User` class. The `blocked` field will indicate whether the contact is blocked or not. Add methods to the `User` class for blocking and unblocking contacts. Write tests to ensure that contact management is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"5. **Messaging**: Define a `Message` class in the `models.py` file. This class will represent the messages sent between users and will have fields such as `id`, `sender_id`, `receiver_id`, `text`, `timestamp`, `read`, and `encrypted`. The `sender_id` and `receiver_id` fields will be foreign keys referencing the `id` field of the `User` class. The `read` field will indicate whether the message has been read or not, and the `encrypted` field will indicate whether the message is encrypted or not. Add methods to the `User` class for sending and receiving messages. Write tests to ensure that messaging is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"6. **Group Chats**: Define a `Group` class and a `GroupMessage` class in the `models.py` file. The `Group` class will represent the group chats and will have fields such as `id`, `name`, `picture`, and `admin_id`. The `admin_id` field will be a foreign key referencing the `id` field of the `User` class. The `GroupMessage` class will represent the messages sent in a group chat and will have fields similar to the `Message` class. Add methods to the `User` class for creating, joining, and leaving group chats. Write tests to ensure that group chats are working correctly.\",\n\n    \"7. **Status/Story Feature**: Define a `Status` class in the `models.py` file. This class will represent the statuses posted by users and will have fields such as `id`, `user_id`, `image`, `timestamp`, and `visibility`. The `user_id` field will be a foreign key referencing the `id` field of the `User` class. The `visibility` field will indicate who can see the status. Add methods to the `User` class for posting and viewing statuses. Write tests to ensure that the status/story feature is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"8. **Web Application**: Create a `routes.py` file and define routes for the various pages of the web application such as the home page, login page, registration page, chat page, group chat page, and status page. Each route should render a corresponding HTML template. Create a `templates` folder and add HTML templates for each of the pages. Also, create a `static` folder for storing static files such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript scripts, and images. Write tests to ensure that the web application is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"9. **Connectivity and Offline Mode**: Add a `last_seen` field to the `User` class to track when a user was last online. Also, add a `queued_messages` field to the `User` class to store messages that are to be sent when the user is offline. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features are working correctly.\",\n\n    \"10. **Final Testing and Deployment**: After all the features have been implemented, perform a final round of testing to ensure that everything is working as expected. Fix any bugs that are found and make any necessary improvements. Once everything is working correctly, deploy the application to a web server.\"\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}], "file_dict": {"requirements.txt": ["Flask", "Flask-SocketIO", "Flask-SQLAlchemy",

Create a new Python project and initialize it with a `requirements.txt` file. This file will list all the Python packages that are required for the project. Some of the packages that will be needed include Flask (for creating the web application), Flask-SocketIO (for real-time communication), Flask-SQLAlchemy (for database operations), Flask-Login (for user authentication), Flask-WTF (for form handling), and Pillow (for image processing). Create a `main.py` file which will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `config.py` file for storing configuration variables such as the secret key and database URI. Write tests to ensure that the project setup is correct and all the required packages are installed.\",\n\n    \"2. **User Registration and Authentication**: Create a `models.py` file and define a `User` class in it. This class will represent the users of the chat application and will have fields such as `id`, `email`, `password`, `profile_picture`, `status_message`, `last_seen`, and `privacy_settings`. The `User` class should also have methods for setting and checking passwords. Next, create a `forms.py` file and define a `RegistrationForm` and a `LoginForm` in it. These forms will be used for user registration and login respectively. The `RegistrationForm` should have fields for email and password, and the `LoginForm` should have fields for email and password. Write tests to ensure that user registration and authentication are working correctly.\",\n\n    \"3. **User Profile**: Add methods to the `User` class for setting and getting the profile picture and status message. Also, add a method for updating the privacy settings. Write tests to ensure that these methods are working correctly.\",\n\n    \"4. **Contact Management**: Define a `Contact` class in the `models.py` file. This class will represent the contacts of a user and will have fields such as `id`, `user_id`, `contact_id`, and `blocked`. The `user_id` and `contact_id` fields will be foreign keys referencing the `id` field of the `User` class. The `blocked` field will indicate whether the contact is blocked or not. Add methods to the `User` class for blocking and unblocking contacts. Write tests to ensure that contact management is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"5. **Messaging**: Define a `Message` class in the `models.py` file. This class will represent the messages sent between users and will have fields such as `id`, `sender_id`, `receiver_id`, `text`, `timestamp`, `read`, and `encrypted`. The `sender_id` and `receiver_id` fields will be foreign keys referencing the `id` field of the `User` class. The `read` field will indicate whether the message has been read or not, and the `encrypted` field will indicate whether the message is encrypted or not. Add methods to the `User` class for sending and receiving messages. Write tests to ensure that messaging is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"6. **Group Chats**: Define a `Group` class and a `GroupMessage` class in the `models.py` file. The `Group` class will represent the group chats and will have fields such as `id`, `name`, `picture`, and `admin_id`. The `admin_id` field will be a foreign key referencing the `id` field of the `User` class. The `GroupMessage` class will represent the messages sent in a group chat and will have fields similar to the `Message` class. Add methods to the `User` class for creating, joining, and leaving group chats. Write tests to ensure that group chats are working correctly.\",\n\n    \"7. **Status/Story Feature**: Define a `Status` class in the `models.py` file. This class will represent the statuses posted by users and will have fields such as `id`, `user_id`, `image`, `timestamp`, and `visibility`. The `user_id` field will be a foreign key referencing the `id` field of the `User` class. The `visibility` field will indicate who can see the status. Add methods to the `User` class for posting and viewing statuses. Write tests to ensure that the status/story feature is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"8. **Web Application**: Create a `routes.py` file and define routes for the various pages of the web application such as the home page, login page, registration page, chat page, group chat page, and status page. Each route should render a corresponding HTML template. Create a `templates` folder and add HTML templates for each of the pages. Also, create a `static` folder for storing static files such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript scripts, and images. Write tests to ensure that the web application is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"9. **Connectivity and Offline Mode**: Add a `last_seen` field to the `User` class to track when a user was last online. Also, add a `queued_messages` field to the `User` class to store messages that are to be sent when the user is offline. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features are working correctly.\",\n\n    \"10. **Final Testing and Deployment**: After all the features have been implemented, perform a final round of testing to ensure that everything is working as expected. Fix any bugs that are found and make any necessary improvements. Once everything is working correctly, deploy the application to a web server.\"\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}], "sub_messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\nObjective: Write code for a large system design task.\n\nYou must act autonomously and you will receive no human input at any stage.
