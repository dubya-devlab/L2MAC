Create a new Python project and initialize it with a `requirements.txt` file. This file will list all the necessary dependencies for the project. Some of the dependencies that will be needed include Flask for creating the web application, Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication, Flask-SQLAlchemy for database operations, Flask-Login for user authentication, Flask-WTF for form handling, and Pillow for image processing. Create a `main.py` file which will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `config.py` file for storing configuration variables such as the secret key and database URI. Write tests to ensure that the project setup is correct and all the necessary dependencies are installed.\",\n\n    \"2. **User Registration and Authentication**: Create a `models.py` file and define a `User` class. This class will represent the users of the chat application and will have fields such as `id`, `email`, `password`, `profile_picture`, `status_message`, `last_seen`, and `privacy_settings`. The `User` class should also have methods for setting and checking passwords. Next, create a `forms.py` file and define a `RegistrationForm` and a `LoginForm`. The `RegistrationForm` should have fields for email and password and should validate that the email is not already taken. The `LoginForm` should have fields for email and password and should validate that the user with the given email exists and that the password is correct. Create routes in `main.py` for user registration and login. Write tests to ensure that user registration and authentication are working correctly.\",\n\n    \"3. **User Profile**: Add methods to the `User` class for setting and getting the profile picture and status message. Also, add a method for updating the privacy settings. Create a `ProfileForm` in `forms.py` for updating the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. Create a route in `main.py` for viewing and updating the user profile. Write tests to ensure that the user profile functionality is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"4. **Contact Management**: Define a `Contact` class in `models.py`. This class will represent the contacts of a user and will have fields such as `id`, `user_id`, `contact_id`, and `blocked`. The `User` class should have a method for blocking and unblocking contacts. Create a `ContactForm` in `forms.py` for adding and editing contacts. Create routes in `main.py` for managing contacts. Write tests to ensure that contact management is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"5. **Messaging**: Define a `Message` class in `models.py`. This class will represent the messages sent between users and will have fields such as `id`, `sender_id`, `receiver_id`, `text`, `timestamp`, `read`, and `image`. The `User` class should have methods for sending and receiving messages. Create a `MessageForm` in `forms.py` for sending messages. Create routes in `main.py` for sending and receiving messages. Also, implement real-time messaging using Flask-SocketIO. Write tests to ensure that messaging is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"6. **Group Chats**: Define a `Group` class and a `GroupMessage` class in `models.py`. The `Group` class will represent the group chats and will have fields such as `id`, `name`, `picture`, and `admin_id`. The `GroupMessage` class will represent the messages sent in group chats and will have fields similar to the `Message` class. The `User` class should have methods for creating, joining, and leaving groups. Create a `GroupForm` and a `GroupMessageForm` in `forms.py` for creating groups and sending group messages. Create routes in `main.py` for managing group chats. Write tests to ensure that group chats are working correctly.\",\n\n    \"7. **Status/Story Feature**: Define a `Status` class in `models.py`. This class will represent the statuses posted by users and will have fields such as `id`, `user_id`, `image`, `timestamp`, and `visibility`. The `User` class should have a method for posting statuses. Create a `StatusForm` in `forms.py` for posting statuses. Create routes in `main.py` for posting and viewing statuses. Write tests to ensure that the status/story feature is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"8. **Web Application**: Create a `templates` folder and add HTML templates for the different pages of the web application. Also, create a `static` folder for storing static files such as CSS and JavaScript files and images. Use Flask's render_template function to render the templates. Write tests to ensure that the web application is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"9. **Connectivity and Offline Mode**: Implement message queuing for when the user is offline. This can be done by adding a `queued` field to the `Message` class and setting it to `True` when a message is sent but the receiver is offline. When the receiver comes online, send all the queued messages. Also, add a `online` field to the `User` class and update it whenever the user's connection status changes. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode functionality is working correctly.\",\n\n    \"10. **Final Testing and Deployment**: After all the features have been implemented, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application. Fix any bugs that are found and make any necessary improvements. Once everything is working as expected, deploy the application to a production server. Write tests to ensure that the deployment is successful and the application is functioning correctly in the production environment.\"\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}]}
