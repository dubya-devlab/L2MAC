Each table should be a dictionary where the key is the unique identifier for the record and the value is another dictionary with the record's data. Write tests to ensure that the database can correctly store and retrieve data.", "2. Implement the user management system. This includes creating a User class with methods for creating a new user, retrieving a user's data, updating a user's data, and deleting a user. The User class should interact with the users table in the database. Also, create a Profile class for managing user profiles. The Profile class should have methods for retrieving a user's profile, updating a user's profile, and listing a user's read and wish-to-read books. Write tests to ensure that the User and Profile classes work correctly.", "3. Implement the book club management system. This includes creating a BookClub class with methods for creating a new book club, retrieving a book club's data, updating a book club's data, and deleting a book club. The BookClub class should interact with the book clubs table in the database. Also, create a Membership class for managing club memberships. The Membership class should have methods for joining a club, leaving a club, and managing member requests and permissions. Write tests to ensure that the BookClub and Membership classes work correctly.", "4. Implement the meeting scheduling system. This includes creating a Meeting class with methods for scheduling a new meeting, retrieving a meeting's data, updating a meeting's data, and deleting a meeting. The Meeting class should interact with the meetings table in the database. Also, create a Reminder class for managing meeting reminders. The Reminder class should have methods for creating a new reminder, retrieving a reminder's data, updating a reminder's data, and deleting a reminder. Write tests to ensure that the Meeting and Reminder classes work correctly.", "5. Implement the discussion forum system. This includes creating a Discussion class with methods for creating a new discussion, retrieving a discussion's data, updating a discussion's data, and deleting a discussion. The Discussion class should interact with the discussions table in the database. Also, create a Comment class for managing comments and replies. The Comment class should have methods for posting a new comment, retrieving a comment's data, updating a comment's data, and deleting a comment. Write tests to ensure that the Discussion and Comment classes work correctly.", "6. Implement the book selection process. This includes creating a Book class with methods for suggesting a new book, retrieving a book's data, updating a book's data, and deleting a book. The Book class should interact with the books table in the database. Also, create a Vote class for managing book votes. The Vote class should have methods for casting a new vote, retrieving a vote's data, updating a vote's data, and deleting a vote. Write tests to ensure that the Book and Vote classes work correctly.", "7. Implement the recommendation engine. This includes creating a Recommendation class with methods for generating book recommendations based on a user's reading history and popular books within the community. The Recommendation class should interact with the books and users tables in the database. Write tests to ensure that the Recommendation class works correctly.", "8. Implement the admin dashboard. This includes creating an Admin class with methods for managing book clubs and user accounts, removing inappropriate content or users, and generating analytics on user engagement and popular books. The Admin class should interact with all tables in the database. Write tests to ensure that the Admin class works correctly.", "9. Implement the notifications and alerts system. This includes creating a Notification class with methods for creating a new notification, retrieving a notification's data, updating a notification's data, and deleting a notification. The Notification class should interact with the notifications table in the database. Write tests to ensure that the Notification class works correctly.", "10. Implement the resource library. This includes creating a Resource class with methods for sharing reading resources, guides, and articles, and for users to contribute to the resource library. The Resource class should interact with a resources table in the database, which should be added to the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the Resource class works correctly."], "step": "8.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
