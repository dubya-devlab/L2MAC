Each model will have its own file in the 'models' directory. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that each model file is created successfully.", "2. Implement the User model. This model will have fields for the user's name, email, password, and a list of books they have read or wish to read. It will also have methods for creating a new user, authenticating a user, and updating a user's information. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that the model is functioning correctly. These tests should cover user creation, authentication, and information updating.", "3. Implement the BookClub model. This model will have fields for the club's name, description, privacy setting, list of members, and current book. It will also have methods for creating a new club, adding members, and updating the club's information. After implementing the BookClub model, write tests to ensure that the model is functioning correctly. These tests should cover club creation, member addition, and information updating.", "4. Implement the Meeting model. This model will have fields for the meeting's date, time, and associated book club. It will also have methods for scheduling a new meeting and sending reminders to club members. After implementing the Meeting model, write tests to ensure that the model is functioning correctly. These tests should cover meeting scheduling and reminder sending.", "5. Implement the Discussion model. This model will have fields for the discussion's topic, associated book club, and list of comments. It will also have methods for creating a new discussion and adding comments. After implementing the Discussion model, write tests to ensure that the model is functioning correctly. These tests should cover discussion creation and comment addition.", "6. Implement the Book model. This model will have fields for the book's title, author, and associated book clubs. It will also have methods for adding a new book and retrieving book information. After implementing the Book model, write tests to ensure that the model is functioning correctly. These tests should cover book addition and information retrieval.", "7. Implement the Notification model. This model will have fields for the notification's content, associated user, and read status. It will also have methods for creating a new notification and updating the read status. After implementing the Notification model, write tests to ensure that the model is functioning correctly. These tests should cover notification creation and status updating.", "8. Implement the routes for the application in the main application file (app.py). These routes will handle user registration and authentication, club creation and management, meeting scheduling, discussion creation, book addition, and notification management. After implementing the routes, write tests to ensure that each route is functioning correctly. These tests should cover all possible requests to each route and check that the correct response is returned.", "9. Implement the recommendation engine.
