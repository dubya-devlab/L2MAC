Start by setting up the basic structure of the application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up the Flask application. Also, create a 'models.py' file to define the data models for the application. These models will include User, BookClub, Meeting, DiscussionForum, Book, and Notification. Each model will have appropriate fields according to the requirements. For example, the User model will have fields like username, email, password, and a list of books read. The BookClub model will have fields like name, description, is_private, members, and current_book. After setting up the basic structure and models, write tests to ensure that the models are defined correctly and can be created, read, updated, and deleted successfully.", "2. Implement the functionality for book club creation and management. This includes creating routes in the Flask application for creating a new book club, joining an existing book club, and managing member requests and permissions. The routes will use the models defined in the previous step. For example, the route for creating a new book club will create a new BookClub model instance and save it. The route for joining a book club will add the user to the members field of the BookClub model. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that book clubs can be created, users can join book clubs, and member requests and permissions can be managed correctly.", "3. Implement the functionality for meeting scheduling. This includes creating a Meeting model with fields like date, time, and attendees. Also, create routes for scheduling a new meeting, viewing upcoming meetings, and integrating with external calendar apps. The route for scheduling a new meeting will create a new Meeting model instance and save it. The route for viewing upcoming meetings will return a list of Meeting model instances. The route for integrating with external calendar apps will export the meeting data in a format that can be imported by the external app. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that meetings can be scheduled, viewed, and exported correctly.", "4. Implement the functionality for discussion forums. This includes creating a DiscussionForum model with fields like title, posts, and book_club. Also, create routes for creating a new discussion forum, posting in a forum, and viewing forum posts. The route for creating a new discussion forum will create a new DiscussionForum model instance and save it. The route for posting in a forum will add the post to the posts field of the DiscussionForum model. The route for viewing forum posts will return a list of posts from the DiscussionForum model. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that discussion forums can be created, posts can be added, and posts can be viewed correctly.", "5. Implement the functionality for the book selection process. This includes creating a Book model with fields like title, author, and votes. Also, create routes for suggesting a new book, voting for a book, and selecting the next book. The route for suggesting a new book will create a new Book model instance and save it. The route for voting for a book will increment the votes field of the Book model. The route for selecting the next book will choose the Book model with the most votes. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that books can be suggested, voted for, and selected correctly.", "6. Implement the functionality for user profiles. This includes adding fields to the User model like interests, books_read, and followed_users. Also, create routes for updating the user profile, viewing a user profile, and following another user. The route for updating the user profile will update the fields of the User model. The route for viewing a user profile will return the User model instance. The route for following another user will add the user to the followed_users field of the User model. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that user profiles can be updated, viewed, and users can be followed correctly.", "7. Implement the functionality for the recommendation engine. This includes creating a function that generates book recommendations based on a user's reading history and popular books within the community. The function will use the books_read field of the User model and the votes field of the Book model to generate recommendations. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that the recommendation engine generates appropriate recommendations.", "8. Implement the functionality for the admin dashboard. This includes creating routes for managing book clubs and user accounts, removing inappropriate content or users, and viewing analytics. The routes will use the models defined in the previous steps. For example, the route for managing book clubs will allow the admin to update the fields of the BookClub model. The route for removing inappropriate content or users will delete the appropriate model instances. The route for viewing analytics will return data like the number of users, number of book clubs, and most popular books. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard works correctly.", "9. Implement the functionality for notifications and alerts. This includes creating a Notification model with fields like user, message, and read. Also, create routes for viewing notifications and marking notifications as read. The route for viewing notifications will return a list of Notification model instances for the user. The route for marking notifications as read will update the read field of the Notification model. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that notifications can be viewed and marked as read correctly.", "10. Implement the functionality for the resource library. This includes creating a Resource model with fields like title, content, and user. Also, create routes for adding a new resource, viewing resources, and contributing to the resource library. The route for adding a new resource will create a new Resource model instance and save it. The route for viewing resources will return a list of Resource model instances. The route for contributing to the resource library will allow the user to update the content field of the Resource model. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that resources can be added, viewed, and updated correctly."], "step": "10. Implement the functionality for the resource library.

You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output.
