This includes creating a function to generate book recommendations based on a user's reading history and popular books within the community. Also, create a route to view book recommendations. Write tests to ensure that the recommendation engine works correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the admin dashboard. This includes creating routes for managing book clubs, managing user accounts, removing inappropriate content, and viewing analytics. Also, create an Admin class to represent an admin. The class should have methods to manage book clubs, manage user accounts, remove inappropriate content, and get analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard works correctly.", "Step 10: Implement the notifications and alerts system.
