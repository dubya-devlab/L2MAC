Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that all files are created and exist in the correct locations.", "Step 2: Implement the Book Club Creation and Management feature. This includes creating a BookClub class with methods to create a new club, set the club as private or public, join an existing club, and manage member requests and permissions. Use an in-memory dictionary to store the book club data. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that a book club can be created, set as private or public, joined, and that member requests and permissions can be managed.", "Step 3: Implement the Meeting Scheduling feature. This includes creating a Meeting class with methods to schedule a meeting, send automated reminders, and integrate with external calendar apps. Use an in-memory dictionary to store the meeting data. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that a meeting can be scheduled, reminders can be sent, and that the calendar can be integrated with external apps.", "Step 4: Implement the Discussion Forums feature. This includes creating a Discussion class with methods to create a forum, post threaded comments and replies, and upload images or links. Use an in-memory dictionary to store the discussion data. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that a forum can be created, comments and replies can be posted, and that images or links can be uploaded.", "Step 5: Implement the Book Selection Process feature. This includes creating a BookSelection class with methods to suggest books, vote for books, and integrate with book databases. Use an in-memory dictionary to store the book selection data. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that books can be suggested, voted for, and that the book database can be integrated.", "Step 6: Implement the User Profiles feature. This includes creating a UserProfile class with methods to create a profile, list books, and follow other readers. Use an in-memory dictionary to store the user profile data. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that a profile can be created, books can be listed, and that other readers can be followed.", "Step 7: Implement the Recommendation Engine feature.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
