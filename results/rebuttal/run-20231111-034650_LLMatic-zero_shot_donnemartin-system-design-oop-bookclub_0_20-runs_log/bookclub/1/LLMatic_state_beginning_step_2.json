This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store data. The database should have tables for users, book clubs, meetings, discussions, books, and notifications. Each table should have appropriate fields based on the requirements. For example, the users table should have fields for username, email, password, and reading interests. The book clubs table should have fields for club name, description, privacy setting, and members. Write tests to ensure that the database is set up correctly and that data can be added, retrieved, and updated successfully.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and login functionality. Users should be able to register with a username, email, and password. Passwords should be hashed for security. Users should also be able to login with their username and password. Implement sessions to keep users logged in. Write tests to ensure that registration, login, and sessions work correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the functionality for users to create and manage book clubs. Users should be able to create a new book club with a unique name and description. They should also be able to set the club as private or public. Club creators should be able to manage member requests and permissions. Write tests to ensure that book clubs can be created and managed successfully.", "Step 4: Implement the functionality for users to join existing book clubs. Users should be able to join public book clubs directly and request to join private clubs. Club administrators should be able to approve or reject these requests. Write tests to ensure that users can join clubs and that club administrators can manage member requests.", "Step 5: Implement the meeting scheduling functionality. This includes creating an integrated calendar for scheduling club meetings and sending automated meeting reminders via email or in-app notifications. Also, provide an option to integrate with external calendar apps. Write tests to ensure that meetings can be scheduled and reminders can be sent successfully.", "Step 6: Implement the discussion forums. Each book club should have a forum for ongoing discussions. Users should be able to post threaded comments and replies in these forums. They should also be able to upload images or links to enhance discussions. Write tests to ensure that discussions can be created and managed successfully.", "Step 7: Implement the book selection process. Club members should be able to suggest books for reading and vote on the club's next book. Integrate with a book database API to fetch information and reviews about the books. Write tests to ensure that books can be suggested, voted on, and information can be fetched from the book database API.", "Step 8: Implement user profiles. Users should be able to create personalized profiles to share their reading interests. They should also be able to list books they have read or wish to read. Implement a follow system to connect with other readers. Write tests to ensure that user profiles can be created and updated successfully.", "Step 9: Implement the recommendation engine. This should provide automated book recommendations based on a user's reading history and popular books within the community. Write tests to ensure that the recommendation engine works correctly.", "Step 10: Implement the admin dashboard. Administrators should be able to manage book clubs and user accounts, remove inappropriate content or users, and view analytics on user engagement and popular books. Also, implement customizable notifications for club activities and new discussions, and email alerts for upcoming meetings or important announcements. Finally, create a resource library section for sharing reading resources, guides, and articles. Users should be able to contribute to this library. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard, notifications, and resource library work correctly."], "step": "Step 3: Implement the functionality for users to create and manage book clubs.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
