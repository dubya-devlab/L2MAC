This includes creating routes for creating a new discussion, posting a comment, and viewing discussions. Also, create a Discussion class to represent a discussion. The class should have methods to create a new discussion, post a comment, and retrieve discussions. Write tests to ensure that the discussion forum system works correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the book selection system. This includes creating routes for suggesting a book, voting for a book, and viewing book selections. Also, create a Book class to represent a book. The class should have methods to suggest a new book, vote for a book, and retrieve book selections. Write tests to ensure that the book selection system works correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the user profile system. This includes creating routes for viewing a user profile, updating a user profile, and following a user. Also, add methods to the User class to update a user profile, list books, and follow a user. Write tests to ensure that the user profile system works correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the recommendation engine. This includes creating a function to generate book recommendations based on a user's reading history and popular books within the community. Write tests to ensure that the recommendation engine works correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the admin dashboard. This includes creating routes for managing book clubs, managing user accounts, and viewing analytics. Also, create an Admin class to represent an admin. The class should have methods to manage book clubs, manage user accounts, remove inappropriate content, and view analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard works correctly.", "Step 10: Implement the notifications and alerts system. This includes creating a function to send notifications for club activities and new discussions, and email alerts for upcoming meetings or important announcements. Also, implement the resource library. This includes creating routes for sharing and viewing resources.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
