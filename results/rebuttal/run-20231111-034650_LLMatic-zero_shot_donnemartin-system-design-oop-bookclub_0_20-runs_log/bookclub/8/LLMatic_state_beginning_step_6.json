These models will include 'User', 'BookClub', 'Meeting', 'Discussion', 'Book', 'Vote', 'Notification', and 'Resource'. Each model will have appropriate fields according to the requirements. For example, the 'User' model will have fields like 'username', 'email', 'password', 'read_books', 'wish_list', 'followed_users', etc. The 'BookClub' model will have fields like 'name', 'description', 'is_private', 'members', 'admin', 'meetings', 'discussions', etc. After setting up the basic structure and models, write tests to ensure that the models are defined correctly and can interact with each other as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the functionality for user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for user registration, login, and logout. Also, create the corresponding views and forms for these routes. The registration form should collect the user's username, email, and password. The login form should collect the user's email and password. After implementing the user registration and authentication functionality, write tests to ensure that users can register, login, and logout successfully.", "Step 3: Implement the functionality for creating and managing book clubs. This includes creating routes for creating a new book club, viewing a book club, editing a book club, and deleting a book club. Also, create the corresponding views and forms for these routes. The form for creating a new book club should collect the club's name, description, and privacy setting. After implementing the book club creation and management functionality, write tests to ensure that users can create, view, edit, and delete book clubs successfully.", "Step 4: Implement the functionality for users to join existing book clubs or request to join private clubs. This includes creating routes for joining a book club and requesting to join a private club. Also, create the corresponding views for these routes. After implementing the join and request functionality, write tests to ensure that users can join public clubs and request to join private clubs successfully.", "Step 5: Implement the functionality for club administrators to manage member requests and permissions. This includes creating routes for viewing member requests, accepting or rejecting requests, and managing member permissions. Also, create the corresponding views for these routes. After implementing the member management functionality, write tests to ensure that club administrators can manage member requests and permissions successfully.", "Step 6: Implement the functionality for scheduling club meetings and sending automated meeting reminders. This includes creating routes for scheduling a new meeting, viewing upcoming meetings, and sending meeting reminders. Also, create the corresponding views and forms for these routes. The form for scheduling a new meeting should collect the meeting's date, time, and book to be discussed. After implementing the meeting scheduling and reminder functionality, write tests to ensure that meetings can be scheduled and reminders can be sent successfully.", "Step 7: Implement the functionality for discussion forums. This includes creating routes for viewing a forum, posting a new discussion, and replying to a discussion. Also, create the corresponding views and forms for these routes. The form for posting a new discussion should collect the discussion's title and content. After implementing the discussion forum functionality, write tests to ensure that users can view forums, post new discussions, and reply to discussions successfully.", "Step 8: Implement the functionality for the book selection process. This includes creating routes for suggesting a new book, voting for a book, and viewing the selected book. Also, create the corresponding views and forms for these routes. The form for suggesting a new book should collect the book's title, author, and description. After implementing the book selection functionality, write tests to ensure that users can suggest books, vote for books, and view the selected book successfully.", "Step 9: Implement the functionality for user profiles. This includes creating routes for viewing a user's profile, editing a user's profile, and following other users. Also, create the corresponding views and forms for these routes. The form for editing a user's profile should collect the user's reading interests, read books, and wish list. After implementing the user profile functionality, write tests to ensure that users can view, edit, and follow profiles successfully.", "Step 10: Implement the functionality for the recommendation engine, admin dashboard, notifications and alerts, and resource library.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
