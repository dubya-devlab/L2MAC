["Step 1: Start by setting up the basic structure of the application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up the Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store data. This dictionary will store information about users, book clubs, meetings, discussions, book selections, user profiles, recommendations, admin dashboard, notifications, and resource library. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database is functioning as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and login system. This includes creating routes for user registration and login, and functions to handle these requests. The user data should be stored in the mock database. The user data should include information such as username, password, email, and a list of book clubs the user is a member of. Write tests to ensure that the user registration and login system is working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the book club creation and management system. This includes creating routes for creating a new book club, joining an existing book club, and managing member requests and permissions. The book club data should be stored in the mock database. The book club data should include information such as the club name, description, whether the club is public or private, the club administrator, and a list of club members. Write tests to ensure that the book club creation and management system is working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the meeting scheduling system. This includes creating routes for scheduling club meetings, sending automated meeting reminders, and integrating with external calendar apps. The meeting data should be stored in the mock database. The meeting data should include information such as the meeting date and time, the book club the meeting is for, and a list of attendees. Write tests to ensure that the meeting scheduling system is working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the discussion forums. This includes creating routes for creating new discussion threads, posting comments and replies, and uploading images or links. The discussion data should be stored in the mock database. The discussion data should include information such as the discussion thread title, the book club the discussion is for, and a list of comments and replies. Write tests to ensure that the discussion forums are working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the book selection process. This includes creating routes for suggesting books for reading, voting for the next book, and integrating with book databases for information and reviews. The book data should be stored in the mock database. The book data should include information such as the book title, author, and a list of votes. Write tests to ensure that the book selection process is working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the user profiles. This includes creating routes for viewing and editing user profiles, listing books the user has read or wishes to read, and following other users. The user profile data should be stored in the mock database. The user profile data should include information such as the user's reading interests, a list of books the user has read or wishes to read, and a list of users the user is following. Write tests to ensure that the user profiles are working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the recommendation engine. This includes creating routes for generating book recommendations based on the user's reading history and highlighting popular books within the community. The recommendation data should be stored in the mock database. The recommendation data should include information such as the recommended book and the reason for the recommendation. Write tests to ensure that the recommendation engine is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the admin dashboard. This includes creating routes for managing book clubs and user accounts, removing inappropriate content or users, and viewing analytics on user engagement and popular books. The admin dashboard data should be stored in the mock database. The admin dashboard data should include information such as a list of all book clubs, a list of all users, and analytics data. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard is working correctly.", "Step 10: Implement the notifications and alerts system. This includes creating routes for setting up customizable notifications for club activities and new discussions, and sending email alerts for upcoming meetings or important announcements. The notification data should be stored in the mock database. The notification data should include information such as the notification type, the user the notification is for, and the notification content.
