This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'models.py' file to define the data models for the application. These models will include 'User', 'BookClub', 'Meeting', 'Discussion', 'Book', 'Notification', and 'Resource'. Each model will have appropriate fields according to the requirements. For instance, the 'User' model will have fields like 'username', 'email', 'password', 'reading_interests', 'read_books', 'wish_to_read_books', etc. The 'BookClub' model will have fields like 'name', 'description', 'is_private', 'members', 'admin', etc. After setting up the basic structure and models, write tests to ensure that the models are defined correctly and can be instantiated with valid data.", "Step 2: Implement the functionality for book club creation and management. This includes creating routes and views for creating a new book club, setting it as private or public, joining an existing book club, and managing member requests and permissions. Use the 'User' and 'BookClub' models defined in the previous step for this purpose. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that a user can create a book club, set it as private or public, join an existing book club, and that the club administrator can manage member requests and permissions.", "Step 3: Implement the functionality for meeting scheduling. This includes creating a 'Meeting' model with fields like 'date', 'time', 'book_club', 'members', etc. Also, create routes and views for scheduling a meeting, viewing upcoming meetings, and integrating with external calendar apps. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that a meeting can be scheduled, viewed, and integrated with external calendar apps.", "Step 4: Implement the functionality for discussion forums. This includes creating a 'Discussion' model with fields like 'title', 'content', 'book_club', 'author', etc. Also, create routes and views for creating a new discussion, viewing existing discussions, and posting comments and replies. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that a discussion can be created, viewed, and that comments and replies can be posted.", "Step 5: Implement the functionality for the book selection process. This includes creating a 'Book' model with fields like 'title', 'author', 'description', 'reviews', etc. Also, create routes and views for suggesting a book, voting for a book, and integrating with book databases for information and reviews. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that a book can be suggested, voted for, and that information and reviews can be fetched from book databases.", "Step 6: Implement the functionality for user profiles. This includes creating routes and views for viewing and editing a user profile, listing books a user has read or wishes to read, and following other users. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that a user profile can be viewed and edited, that books can be listed, and that users can follow each other.", "Step 7: Implement the functionality for the recommendation engine. This includes creating a function that generates book recommendations based on a user's reading history and popular books within the community. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that the recommendation engine generates appropriate recommendations.", "Step 8: Implement the functionality for the admin dashboard. This includes creating routes and views for managing book clubs and user accounts, removing inappropriate content or users, and viewing analytics on user engagement and popular books.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
