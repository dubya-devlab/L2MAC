After setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files, write tests to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and that the necessary files exist.", "Step 2: Implement the User Accounts and Profiles feature. This will involve creating a User class with attributes such as username, password, submitted recipes, and favorite recipes. The User class will also have methods for creating and managing accounts, and for saving favorite recipes. After implementing the User class, write tests to ensure that the User class is functioning as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the Recipe Submission and Management feature. This will involve creating a Recipe class with attributes such as name, ingredients, instructions, images, and categories. The Recipe class will also have methods for submitting, editing, and deleting recipes, and for validating the recipe format. After implementing the Recipe class, write tests to ensure that the Recipe class is functioning as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the Search and Categorization feature.

After implementing the Search class, write tests to ensure that the Search class is functioning as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the Ratings and Reviews feature.

The Rating class will also have methods for rating recipes and writing reviews, and for calculating the average rating of a recipe. After implementing the Rating class, write tests to ensure that the Rating class is functioning as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the Community Features. This will involve adding methods to the User class for following other users or chefs, and for viewing a feed showing recent activity of followed users. It will also involve adding a method to the Recipe class for sharing recipes on social media platforms. After implementing the Community Features, write tests to ensure that the new methods in the User and Recipe classes are functioning as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the Admin Dashboard feature. This will involve creating an Admin class with methods for managing all submitted recipes and for removing inappropriate content. The Admin class will also have methods for monitoring site usage statistics and user engagement. After implementing the Admin class, write tests to ensure that the Admin class is functioning as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the Recipe Recommendations feature.

It includes features for categorizing recipes, user ratings and reviews, and personal recipe management.\n\n**Functional Requirements to implement**:\n\n1. **Recipe Submission and Management**:\n   - [ ] 1.1. Users can submit recipes with ingredients, instructions, and images.\n   - [ ] 1.2. Recipe submissions include options for categorization (e.g., cuisine type, dietary restrictions).\n   - [ ] 1.3. Users can edit or delete their submitted recipes.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Recipe format validation to ensure complete information.\n\n2. **Search and Categorization**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Users can search for recipes based on ingredients, recipe name, or categories.\n   - [ ] 2.2. Categorization of recipes by type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner), cuisine, or dietary needs (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).\n\n3. **User Accounts and Profiles**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can create and manage accounts.\n   - [ ] 3.2. Account holders can save favorite recipes.\n   - [ ] 3.3. Profile pages showing submitted recipes and favorite recipes.\n\n4. **Ratings and Reviews**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can rate recipes on a 5-star scale.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Users can write reviews for recipes.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Display of average rating on recipe pages.\n\n5. **Community Features**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Users can follow other users or chefs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Feed showing recent activity of followed users (new recipes, ratings).\n   - [ ] 5.3. Option to share recipes on social media platforms.\n\n6. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Administrators can manage all submitted recipes.\n   - [ ] 6.2. Administrators can remove inappropriate content.\n   - [ ] 6.3. Monitoring of site usage statistics and user engagement.\n\n7. **Recipe Recommendations**:\n   - [ ] 7.1. System generates recipe recommendations based on user preferences and past activity.\n   - [ ] 7.2. Users receive notifications for new recipes in their interest areas.\n\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating an extremely detailed step-by-step plan, where each step is long (multiple sentences) and in total includes every single feature requirement specified above, feel free to copy directly from it. Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
