It includes features for categorizing recipes, user ratings and reviews, and personal recipe management.\n\n**Functional Requirements to implement**:\n\n1. **Recipe Submission and Management**:\n   - [ ] 1.1. Users can submit recipes with ingredients, instructions, and images.\n   - [ ] 1.2. Recipe submissions include options for categorization (e.g., cuisine type, dietary restrictions).\n   - [ ] 1.3. Users can edit or delete their submitted recipes.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Recipe format validation to ensure complete information.\n\n2. **Search and Categorization**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Users can search for recipes based on ingredients, recipe name, or categories.\n   - [ ] 2.2. Categorization of recipes by type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner), cuisine, or dietary needs (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).\n\n3. **User Accounts and Profiles**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can create and manage accounts.\n   - [ ] 3.2. Account holders can save favorite recipes.\n   - [ ] 3.3. Profile pages showing submitted recipes and favorite recipes.\n\n4. **Ratings and Reviews**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can rate recipes on a 5-star scale.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Users can write reviews for recipes.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Display of average rating on recipe pages.\n\n5. **Community Features**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Users can follow other users or chefs.\n   - [ ] 5.2.

Users receive notifications for new recipes in their interest areas.\n\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating an extremely detailed step-by-step plan, where each step is long (multiple sentences) and in total includes every single feature requirement specified above, feel free to copy directly from it. Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.

You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}], "message_hash": "b157aecd598dba5a9683257d0d703fa407ba17b604f63395e8121ad10d07c2ae"}
