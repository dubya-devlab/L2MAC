Users can submit recipes with ingredients, instructions, and images.\n   - [ ] 1.2. Recipe submissions include options for categorization (e.g., cuisine type, dietary restrictions).\n   - [ ] 1.3. Users can edit or delete their submitted recipes.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Recipe format validation to ensure complete information.\n\n2. **Search and Categorization**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Users can search for recipes based on ingredients, recipe name, or categories.\n   - [ ] 2.2. Categorization of recipes by type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner), cuisine, or dietary needs (e.g., vegan, gluten-free).\n\n3. **User Accounts and Profiles**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can create and manage accounts.\n   - [ ] 3.2. Account holders can save favorite recipes.\n   - [ ] 3.3. Profile pages showing submitted recipes and favorite recipes.\n\n4. **Ratings and Reviews**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can rate recipes on a 5-star scale.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Users can write reviews for recipes.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Display of average rating on recipe pages.\n\n5. **Community Features**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Users can follow other users or chefs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Feed showing recent activity of followed users (new recipes, ratings).\n   - [ ] 5.3. Option to share recipes on social media platforms.\n\n6. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 6.1.

Monitoring of site usage statistics and user engagement.\n\n7. **Recipe Recommendations**:\n   - [ ] 7.1. System generates recipe recommendations based on user preferences and past activity.\n   - [ ] 7.2. Users receive notifications for new recipes in their interest areas.\n\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating an extremely detailed step-by-step plan, where each step is long (multiple sentences) and in total includes every single feature requirement specified above, feel free to copy directly from it. Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
