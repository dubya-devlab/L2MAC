When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}], "message_hash": "b157aecd598dba5a9683257d0d703fa407ba17b604f63395e8121ad10d07c2ae"}
