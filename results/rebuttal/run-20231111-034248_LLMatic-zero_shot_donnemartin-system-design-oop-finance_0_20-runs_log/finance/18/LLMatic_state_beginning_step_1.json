Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "10. **Mobile App and Web Interface**: Implement a Flask application in the `app.py` file. This application should provide endpoints for all the features implemented in the previous steps. Implement a simple HTML and CSS frontend for the web interface. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application and the frontend work as expected. Run these tests to confirm that they pass."], "step": "2. **Income and Expense Tracking**: Create the `Transaction` class in the `transaction.py` file.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
