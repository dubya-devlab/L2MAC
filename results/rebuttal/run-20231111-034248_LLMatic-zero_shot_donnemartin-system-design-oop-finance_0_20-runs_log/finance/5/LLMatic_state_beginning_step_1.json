After implementing these features, write tests in the `test_user.py` file to ensure that the `User` class works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "2. **Income and Expense Tracking**: Create the `Transaction` class in the `transaction.py` file. This class should have attributes for `amount`, `category`, `date`, and `is_recurring`. Implement methods for manually entering a transaction and categorizing a transaction. For recurring transactions, add a method that checks if a transaction is recurring based on the user's past transactions. After implementing these features, write tests in the `test_transaction.py` file to ensure that the `Transaction` class works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "3. **Bank Account Integration**: Create the `Account` class in the `account.py` file.

This class should have attributes for `investment_name`, `investment_type`, `amount_invested`, `current_value`, and `roi`. Implement methods for adding an investment, tracking an investment, and alerting the user of significant changes in investment values. After implementing these features, write tests in the `test_investment.py` file to ensure that the `Investment` class works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "6. **Analytics and Reporting**: Implement methods in the `User` class for generating monthly financial reports, visual analytics for spending habits and trends, and year-on-year financial comparison. After implementing these features, write tests in the `test_user.py` file to ensure that the analytics and reporting features work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "7. **Savings Tips and Recommendations**: Implement a method in the `User` class that provides personalized tips for saving money based on the user's income, expenses, and savings. Also, implement a method that recommends financial products based on the user's profile. After implementing these features, write tests in the `test_user.py` file to ensure that the savings tips and recommendations feature works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "8. **Notifications and Alerts**: Implement methods in the `User` class for setting customizable notifications for upcoming bills and payments, and alerts for unusual account activity or potential fraud. After implementing these features, write tests in the `test_user.py` file to ensure that the notifications and alerts feature works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "9. **Data Security and Privacy**: Implement strong data encryption and privacy protection measures in the `User` class. Also, implement a method for conducting regular security audits. After implementing these features, write tests in the `test_user.py` file to ensure that the data security and privacy features work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "10. **Mobile App and Web Interface**: Implement a Flask application in the `app.py` file. This application should provide endpoints for all the features implemented in the previous steps. After implementing the Flask application, write tests in the `test_app.py` file to ensure that the application works as expected. Run these tests using pytest."], "step": "2. **Income and Expense Tracking**: Create the `Transaction` class in the `transaction.py` file.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
