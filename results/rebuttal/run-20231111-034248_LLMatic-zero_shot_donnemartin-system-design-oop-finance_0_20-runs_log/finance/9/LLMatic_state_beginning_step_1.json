Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
