Write the `requirements.txt` file with these dependencies and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them. Create a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and all dependencies are installed successfully.", "2. Implement the User Registration and Authentication features. Create a `user.py` file and define a `User` class with attributes for email, password, and other user details. Implement methods for user sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up method should take an email and password, create a new User instance, and store it in an in-memory dictionary acting as a mock database. The forgotten password recovery method should take an email, verify that a User with that email exists, and return a password reset link. Create tests for these methods to ensure they work as expected.", "3. Implement the User Profile features. Add attributes to the `User` class for profile picture and status message. Implement methods for setting these attributes and for setting privacy settings. The privacy settings should determine who can see the user's details or last seen status. Create tests for these methods to ensure they work as expected.", "4. Implement the Contact Management features. Create a `contact.py` file and define a `Contact` class with attributes for blocked contacts and groups. Implement methods for blocking and unblocking contacts and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The groups should be stored as lists of User instances. Create tests for these methods to ensure they work as expected.", "5. Implement the Messaging features. Create a `message.py` file and define a `Message` class with attributes for sender, receiver, content, read receipt, and encryption. Implement methods for sending and receiving messages, setting read receipts, encrypting and decrypting messages, and sharing images. The messages should be stored in an in-memory dictionary acting as a mock database. Create tests for these methods to ensure they work as expected.", "6. Implement the Group Chats features. Add attributes to the `Group` class for name, picture, participants, and admin roles. Implement methods for adding and removing participants and for setting admin roles and permissions. Create tests for these methods to ensure they work as expected.", "7. Implement the Status/Story Feature. Add an attribute to the `User` class for status and implement a method for posting a status. The status should be an image and should be visible for a limited time. Implement a method for controlling who can see the status. Create tests for these methods to ensure they work as expected.", "8. Implement the Web Application feature. Create a `app.py` file and set up a Flask web server. Define routes for the various features of the application, such as user registration, messaging, and status posting. Create tests for these routes to ensure they work as expected.", "9. Implement the Connectivity and Offline Mode features. Add an attribute to the `User` class for online status and implement methods for setting this status and for queuing messages when the user is offline. The queued messages should be sent once the user's status is set to online. Create tests for these methods to ensure they work as expected.", "10.
