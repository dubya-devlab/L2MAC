Also, create the main application file, app.py, and a test file, test_app.py. Write a simple Flask application in app.py that just returns a 'Hello, World!' message. Write a test in test_app.py that checks if the application is running and returns the correct message. Run the application and the test to make sure everything is set up correctly.", "2. Implement the user registration and authentication system. Create a new file, auth.py, and write a function for signing up users. This function should take an email and password, hash the password, and store the user details in a dictionary. Write another function for logging in users. This function should take an email and password, hash the password, and compare it with the stored hash. If they match, the function should return a success message; otherwise, it should return an error message. Write tests for these functions in a new file, test_auth.py, and run them to make sure they work correctly.", "3. Implement the forgotten password recovery feature. Add a function in auth.py that generates a password reset link for a given email. The link should contain a unique token that can be used to verify the user's identity. Write another function that takes a token and a new password, verifies the token, and updates the user's password.

Create a new file, profile.py, and write a function for setting profile pictures and status messages. This function should take a user's email, a picture, and a status message, and update the user's profile in the dictionary. Write another function for setting privacy settings. This function should take a user's email and a privacy setting, and update the user's privacy setting in the dictionary.

Create a new file, contacts.py, and write a function for blocking and unblocking contacts. This function should take a user's email and another user's email, and update the user's blocked contacts list in the dictionary. Write another function for creating, editing, and managing groups. This function should take a user's email, a group name, and a list of emails, and update the user's groups in the dictionary. Write tests for these functions in a new file, test_contacts.py, and run them to make sure they work correctly.", "6. Implement the messaging feature. Create a new file, messaging.py, and write a function for sending and receiving real-time text messages. This function should take a sender's email, a receiver's email, and a message, and update the receiver's messages in the dictionary. Write another function for sending read receipts.

Add a function in messaging.py for creating group chats. This function should take a user's email, a group name, a picture, and a list of emails, and create a new group chat in the dictionary. Write another function for adding or removing participants. This function should take a user's email, a group name, and a list of emails, and update the group chat's participants in the dictionary. Write tests for these functions in test_messaging.py and run them to make sure they work correctly.", "8. Implement the status/story feature. Create a new file, status.py, and write a function for posting image statuses. This function should take a user's email, an image, and a visibility setting, and update the user's statuses in the dictionary. Write another function for controlling who can see the status. This function should take a user's email, a status id, and a list of emails, and update the status's visibility in the dictionary. Write tests for these functions in a new file, test_status.py, and run them to make sure they work correctly.", "9. Implement the web application feature. Update app.py to serve the web application. Use Flask's routing system to map URLs to the functions you've written. For example, map '/signup' to the signup function, '/login' to the login function, and so on. Write tests for these routes in test_app.py and run them to make sure they work correctly.", "10. Implement the connectivity and offline mode feature. Add a function in messaging.py for queuing messages when the user is offline. This function should take a sender's email, a receiver's email, and a message, and add the message to the receiver's message queue in the dictionary. Write another function for displaying online/offline status. This function should take a user's email and return the user's online status from the dictionary. Write tests for these functions in test_messaging.py and run them to make sure they work correctly."], "step": "8. Implement the status/story feature.
