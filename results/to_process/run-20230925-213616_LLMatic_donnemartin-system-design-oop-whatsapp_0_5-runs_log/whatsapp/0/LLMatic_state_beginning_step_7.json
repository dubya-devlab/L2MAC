Write a simple test in the test file to ensure that the project setup is correct. Run the test to verify.", "2. Implement the user registration and authentication system. Create a new file, auth.py, and define a User dataclass with fields for email, password, and other necessary information. Implement a function for user registration that takes in an email and password, creates a new User instance, and stores it in an in-memory dictionary. Also, implement a function for password recovery that takes in an email, checks if a User with that email exists, and returns the User's password if it does. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "3. Implement the user profile system. In the auth.py file, add fields to the User dataclass for profile picture and status message. Implement functions for setting these fields. Also, implement a function for setting privacy settings that determines who can see a User's details or last seen status. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "4. Implement the contact management system. Create a new file, contacts.py, and define a Contact dataclass with fields for the contact's email and blocked status.

Also, implement functions for creating, editing, and managing groups. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "5. Implement the messaging system. Create a new file, messages.py, and define a Message dataclass with fields for the sender's email, the recipient's email, the message content, read receipt status, and encryption status. Implement a function for sending messages that takes in a sender's email, a recipient's email, and a message, creates a new Message instance, and stores it in an in-memory dictionary. Also, implement functions for reading messages, updating read receipt status, encrypting messages, and sharing images. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "6. Implement the group chat system. In the messages.py file, add a field to the Message dataclass for the group chat's name. Implement a function for creating group chats that takes in a name and a list of participant emails, and creates a new group chat. Also, implement functions for adding or removing participants, and setting admin roles and permissions. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "7. Implement the status/story feature. Create a new file, status.py, and define a Status dataclass with fields for the user's email, the status content, and the visibility settings. Implement a function for posting statuses that takes in a user's email, a status, and visibility settings, creates a new Status instance, and stores it in an in-memory dictionary. Write tests for this function and run them to ensure it works correctly.", "8. Implement the web application. In the app.py file, define routes for the various features of the application, such as user registration, messaging, and posting statuses. Use the Flask framework to handle HTTP requests and responses. Write tests for these routes and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "9. Implement the connectivity and offline mode. In the messages.py file, add a field to the Message dataclass for the message's queued status.
