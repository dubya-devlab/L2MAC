Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. This includes the main application file (app.py), a file for user management (user.py), a file for file management (file.py), a file for sharing functionality (share.py), a file for security features (security.py), and a file for UI/UX (ui.py). Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that all files are created and the project structure is correctly set up.", "2. Implement the User Registration feature in the user.py file. This includes creating a User class with attributes for name, email, and password. Also, create a register method that takes these attributes as parameters and adds a new user to a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). After implementing this feature, write a test to ensure that a new user can be registered and added to the mock database.", "3. Implement the User Login feature in the user.py file. This includes creating a login method that takes email and password as parameters and checks if a user with these credentials exists in the mock database. If such a user exists, the method should return a success message; otherwise, it should return an error message. Also, implement the Forgot Password functionality by creating a forgot_password method that takes an email as a parameter and resets the password for the user with this email. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a user can log in with valid credentials, cannot log in with invalid credentials, and can reset their password.", "4. Implement the User Profile feature in the user.py file. This includes creating a profile method that takes a user's email as a parameter and returns the user's profile information (name, email, profile picture, storage used/remaining). Also, create a change_password method that takes a user's email, old password, and new password as parameters and changes the user's password if the old password is correct. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a user's profile information can be retrieved and their password can be changed.", "5. Implement the File Upload and Download features in the file.py file. This includes creating a File class with attributes for file name, file type, file size, and file content. Also, create an upload method that takes a File object and a user's email as parameters and adds the file to the user's storage in the mock database. Create a download method that takes a file name and a user's email as parameters and returns the corresponding File object. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a file can be uploaded to a user's storage and downloaded from it.", "6. Implement the File/Folder Organization and File Versioning features in the file.py file. This includes creating methods for creating folders, renaming files/folders, moving files/folders, deleting files/folders, and maintaining and restoring historical versions of files. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that files/folders can be organized and file versions can be maintained and restored.", "7. Implement the Shareable Links and Shared Folders features in the share.py file. This includes creating methods for generating shareable URL links for files/folders, setting expiry dates and password protection for these links, inviting users via email to shared folders, and setting permissions for these users. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that shareable links can be generated and shared folders can be managed.", "8. Implement the Encryption and Activity Log features in the security.py file. This includes creating methods for encrypting and decrypting files, and for tracking user actions like uploads, downloads, shares, etc. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that files can be encrypted and decrypted, and user actions can be tracked.", "9. Implement the Responsive Design, Themes, and File Preview features in the ui.py file. This includes creating methods for adjusting the UI for different screen sizes, switching between light and dark modes, and generating thumbnails and document viewers for different file types. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the UI can be adjusted, themes can be switched, and files can be previewed.", "10. Finally, integrate all the features in the main application file (app.py). This includes setting up routes for user registration, login, profile management, file upload, download, organization, versioning, sharing, and security. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that all routes are correctly set up and all features work together as expected."], "step": "1.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
