For password management, use a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt. For authentication, use JWT or a similar protocol. Also, implement a method for resetting forgotten passwords. After implementing these features, write tests in a file named `test_user.py` to ensure that user registration, authentication, and password reset are working correctly.", "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Extend the `User` class to include additional attributes for `profile_picture`, `bio`, `website_link`, and `location`. Implement methods for editing these profile attributes. Also, implement a method for toggling the `is_private` attribute. After implementing these features, update the tests in `test_user.py` to ensure that profile management is working correctly.", "3. **Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Create a `Post` class in a file named `post.py`.

After implementing these features, write tests in a file named `test_post.py` to ensure that post creation and deletion are working correctly.", "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Extend the `Post` class to include methods for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts. For replies, consider using a nested comment structure. After implementing these features, update the tests in `test_post.py` to ensure that post interaction is working correctly.", "5. **Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement a `Search` class in a file named `search.py`. This class should have methods for searching for specific posts or users using keywords, and for filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. After implementing these features, write tests in a file named `test_search.py` to ensure that content filtering and search are working correctly.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Extend the `User` class to include methods for following and unfollowing other users, and for displaying a timeline view of posts from followed users. Also, implement a method for notifying users of new followers. After implementing these features, update the tests in `test_user.py` to ensure that following, unfollowing, and follower notifications are working correctly.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Implement a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender` (a `User` object), `recipient` (a `User` object), `text`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for sending messages and for blocking/unblocking users. After implementing these features, write tests in a file named `test_message.py` to ensure that direct messaging and user blocking/unblocking are working correctly.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Extend the `User` class to include a method for notifying users of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions. After implementing this feature, update the tests in `test_user.py` to ensure that notifications are working correctly.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `Trending` class in a file named `trending.py`. This class should have methods for identifying and displaying trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions, and for sorting trending topics based on location or globally. After implementing these features, write tests in a file named `test_trending.py` to ensure that trending topics are working correctly.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Extend the `User` class to include a method for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
