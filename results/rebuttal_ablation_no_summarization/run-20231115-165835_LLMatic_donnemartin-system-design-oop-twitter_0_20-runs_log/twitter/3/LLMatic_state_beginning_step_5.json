Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up and that all dependencies are correctly installed.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password, and a function to register new users. The function should take in the user's email, username, and password, create a new User instance, and store it in an in-memory dictionary that acts as a mock database. Also, implement the user authentication feature. This involves creating a function that takes in a username and password, checks if a User with the given username and password exists in the mock database, and returns a JWT token if the authentication is successful. Write tests to ensure that the user registration and authentication features work as expected.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile picture, bio, website link, and location, and creating functions to edit these fields. Also, add a field to the User dataclass to indicate whether the profile is private or public, and create a function to toggle this field. Write tests to ensure that the profile management feature works as expected.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass with fields for text, images, and the user who created the post, and a function to create new posts. The function should take in the text, images, and user, create a new Post instance, and store it in the mock database. Also, implement the post interaction feature. This involves creating functions to like, retweet, and reply to posts. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content management features work as expected.", "5. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves creating a function that takes in a keyword and returns all posts that contain the keyword. Also, implement the filter option based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. This involves creating functions that take in a hashtag, user mention, or trending topic, and return all posts that contain the given hashtag, user mention, or trending topic. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search features work as expected.", "6. **Implement Social Interaction:** Implement the following and followers feature. This involves adding fields to the User dataclass for following and followers, and creating functions to follow and unfollow other users. Also, implement the timeline view feature. This involves creating a function that takes in a user and returns all posts from the users that the given user is following. Write tests to ensure that the social interaction features work as expected.", "7. **Implement Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for the sender, receiver, and text, and a function to send new messages. The function should take in the sender, receiver, and text, create a new Message instance, and store it in the mock database. Also, implement the block/unblock feature. This involves adding a field to the User dataclass for blocked users, and creating functions to block and unblock other users. Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging feature works as expected.", "8. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for the user who will receive the notification and the notification text, and a function to create new notifications. The function should take in the user and notification text, create a new Notification instance, and store it in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the notifications feature works as expected.", "9. **Implement Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending topics feature. This involves creating a function that identifies and returns trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. Also, implement the user recommendations feature. This involves creating a function that recommends users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery features work as expected.", "10. **Final Testing and Refactoring:** After implementing all the features, perform a final round of testing to ensure that all features work together as expected. If any bugs or issues are found, refactor the code as necessary to fix them. Also, review the code to ensure that it follows best practices for coding style and structure. Finally, write tests to ensure that the final product works as expected."], "step": "6. **Implement Social Interaction:** Implement the following and followers feature.
