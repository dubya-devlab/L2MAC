Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and the application runs without errors.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store user data. Implement the registration route (/register) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with user data (email, username, password), create a new User object, and store it in the mock database. Implement the authentication feature. This involves creating a login route (/login) that accepts POST requests with username and password, verifies the credentials against the mock database, and returns a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication features work as expected.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Also, add a field for profile visibility (public or private). Implement a route (/profile) in the Flask application for managing user profiles. This route should accept GET requests to retrieve profile information and PUT requests to update profile information. The route should check the JWT token in the request to authenticate the user. Write tests to ensure that the profile management feature works as expected.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass with fields for post content, post images, and user who created the post. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store post data. Implement a route (/post) in the Flask application for creating and deleting posts. This route should accept POST requests to create new posts and DELETE requests to delete existing posts. The route should check the JWT token in the request to authenticate the user. Implement the content interaction feature. This involves adding fields to the Post dataclass for likes, retweets, and replies. The /post route should also accept PUT requests to update these fields. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content management features work as expected.", "5. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves creating a route (/search) in the Flask application that accepts GET requests with search keywords. The route should return posts and users that match the search keywords. Also, implement a route (/filter) that accepts GET requests with filter options (hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics) and returns posts that match the filter options. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search features work as expected.", "6. **Implement Following & Followers:** Implement the following and followers feature. This involves adding fields to the User dataclass for following and followers. Also, implement a route (/follow) in the Flask application that accepts POST requests to follow a user and DELETE requests to unfollow a user. The route should check the JWT token in the request to authenticate the user. Implement a route (/timeline) that accepts GET requests and returns posts from followed users. Write tests to ensure that the following and followers features work as expected.", "7. **Implement Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for sender, receiver, and message content. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store message data. Implement a route (/message) in the Flask application that accepts POST requests to send messages and GET requests to retrieve messages. The route should check the JWT token in the request to authenticate the user. Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging feature works as expected.", "8. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for user, notification type (like, retweet, reply, mention), and related post or message. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store notification data. Implement a route (/notification) in the Flask application that accepts GET requests to retrieve notifications. The route should check the JWT token in the request to authenticate the user. Write tests to ensure that the notifications feature works as expected.", "9. **Implement Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending topics feature. This involves creating a route (/trending) in the Flask application that accepts GET requests and returns trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. Implement the user recommendations feature. This involves creating a route (/recommend) that accepts GET requests and returns recommended users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery features work as expected.", "10. **Final Testing & Cleanup:** After implementing all the features, perform a final round of testing to ensure that all features work together as expected. This involves running all the tests written in the previous steps. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues. After all tests pass, cleanup the code by removing any unnecessary comments or debug statements. Also, update the requirements.txt file if any additional Python packages were used during development."], "step": "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass with fields for post content, post images, and user who created the post. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store post data.
