project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and folders. The project structure should include a main application file (app.py), a models file (models.py) for database models, a views file (views.py) for handling HTTP requests, and a utilities file (utils.py) for helper functions. Also, create a tests folder for storing all test files. Each feature module should have its own test file prefixed with 'test_'. For instance, user management tests should be in a file named 'test_user_management.py'. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to manage Python package dependencies. The packages should include Flask, Pytest, and PyJWT among others. Lastly, write tests to confirm that the project structure and environment are correctly setup.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** In the models.py file, define a User model with fields for email, username, and password. The password should be hashed before being stored in the database. In the views.py file, create endpoints for user registration and login. The registration endpoint should validate the user input, check if a user with the same email or username already exists, and if not, create a new user. The login endpoint should validate the user input, check if the user exists and if the password is correct, and if so, generate a JWT token and return it to the user. In the utils.py file, create helper functions for validating user input and generating JWT tokens. Lastly, write tests to confirm that user registration and authentication are working correctly.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** In the User model, add fields for profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Also, add a boolean field for profile visibility (public or private). In the views.py file, create endpoints for updating user profile and viewing a user profile. The update profile endpoint should validate the user input and update the user's profile. The view profile endpoint should return the user's profile if it's public or if the requesting user is the user themselves. Lastly, write tests to confirm that profile management is working correctly.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** In the models.py file, define a Post model with fields for text content, image, and user. The user field should be a foreign key referencing the User model. In the views.py file, create endpoints for creating, deleting, and viewing posts. The create post endpoint should validate the user input and create a new post. The delete post endpoint should delete a post if the requesting user is the post's user. The view post endpoint should return a post's details. Lastly, write tests to confirm that posting and content management are working correctly.", "5. **Implement Interacting with Posts:** In the models.py file, define models for likes, retweets, and replies. Each of these models should have a user field (a foreign key referencing the User model) and a post field (a foreign key referencing the Post model). In the views.py file, create endpoints for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts. Each of these endpoints should create a new like, retweet, or reply respectively. Lastly, write tests to confirm that interacting with posts is working correctly.", "6. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** In the views.py file, create an endpoint for searching posts and users. This endpoint should accept a keyword as input and return posts and users that match the keyword. Also, create an endpoint for filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. This endpoint should accept a filter type and value as input and return posts that match the filter. Lastly, write tests to confirm that content filtering and search are working correctly.", "7. **Implement Following & Followers:** In the models.py file, define a Follow model with fields for follower and followee. Both fields should be foreign keys referencing the User model. In the views.py file, create endpoints for following and unfollowing users. The follow endpoint should create a new follow record, and the unfollow endpoint should delete a follow record. Also, create an endpoint for viewing a user's timeline. This endpoint should return posts from users that the requesting user follows. Lastly, write tests to confirm that following and followers functionality is working correctly.", "8. **Implement Direct Messaging:** In the models.py file, define a Message model with fields for sender, receiver, and text content. Both sender and receiver fields should be foreign keys referencing the User model. In the views.py file, create endpoints for sending messages and viewing conversation threads. The send message endpoint should create a new message, and the view conversation thread endpoint should return messages between the requesting user and another user. Lastly, write tests to confirm that direct messaging is working correctly.", "9. **Implement Notifications:** In the models.py file, define a Notification model with fields for user, type, and related post. The user field should be a foreign key referencing the User model, and the related post field should be a foreign key referencing the Post model. In the views.py file, create an endpoint for viewing notifications. This endpoint should return notifications for the requesting user. Also, modify the like, retweet, reply, and follow endpoints to create a notification whenever a like, retweet, reply, or follow is created. Lastly, write tests to confirm that notifications are working correctly.", "10. **Implement Trending & Discovery:** In the views.py file, create an endpoint for viewing trending topics. This endpoint should return hashtags or topics that have a high volume and velocity of mentions. Also, create an endpoint for viewing user recommendations. This endpoint should return users that the requesting user might be interested in following, based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Lastly, write tests to confirm that trending and discovery are working correctly."], "step": "7. **Implement Following & Followers:** In the models.py file, define a Follow model with fields for follower and followee. Both fields should be foreign keys referencing the User model. In the views.py file, create endpoints for following and unfollowing users. The follow endpoint should create a new follow record, and the unfollow endpoint should delete a follow record. Also, create an endpoint for viewing a user's timeline. This endpoint should return posts from users that the requesting user follows.
