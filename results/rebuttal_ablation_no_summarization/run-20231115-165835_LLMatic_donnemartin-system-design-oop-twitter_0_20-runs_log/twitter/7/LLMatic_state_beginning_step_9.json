Finally, write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly setup and that all dependencies are installed.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication functionality. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store user data. Implement the registration functionality, which involves adding new users to the mock database. Implement the authentication functionality, which involves checking if a user's credentials exist in the mock database. Use JWT for secure authentication. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication functionality works as expected.", "3. **User Profile Management:** Implement the user profile management functionality. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Also, add a field for profile visibility (public or private).

Write tests to ensure that the post creation and deletion functionality works as expected.", "5. **Interacting with Posts:** Implement the functionality for interacting with posts. This involves creating a Comment dataclass with fields for the comment text, the user who created the comment, and the post the comment is associated with. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store comment data. Implement functionality for users to like, retweet, and reply to posts. Write tests to ensure that the post interaction functionality works as expected.", "6. **Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search functionality. This involves creating a Search function that takes a keyword and returns posts and users that match the keyword. Also, implement a Filter function that takes a hashtag, user mention, or trending topic and returns relevant posts. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search functionality works as expected.", "7. **Following & Followers:** Implement the following and followers functionality. This involves adding fields to the User dataclass for following and followers (both lists of User objects). Implement functionality for users to follow and unfollow other users. Also, implement a timeline view that displays posts from followed users. Write tests to ensure that the following and followers functionality works as expected.", "8. **Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging functionality. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for the message text, the sender, and the receiver. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store message data. Implement functionality for users to send messages to other users and to block/unblock users from messaging. Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging functionality works as expected.", "9. **Notifications:** Implement the notifications functionality. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for the notification text and the user who will receive the notification.

No placeholders.\nOnly use the functions you have been provided with.\nOnly use the `write_files` to output code.\n\nYou must act autonomously and you will receive no human input at any stage. You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}], "message_hash": "0de0601371f65ed824374f92588aa6bcd4095dabe98cb231f6fab7c5207c9aaa"}
