Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly setup and that all dependencies are installed.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication functionality. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store user data. Implement the registration functionality, which involves adding new users to the mock database. Implement the authentication functionality, which involves checking if a user's credentials exist in the mock database. Use JWT for secure authentication. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication functionality works as expected.", "3. **User Profile Management:** Implement the user profile management functionality. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Also, add a field for profile visibility (public or private). Implement functionality for users to edit their profile information. Write tests to ensure that the profile management functionality works as expected.", "4. **Creating Posts (Tweets):** Implement the functionality for creating posts. This involves creating a Post dataclass with fields for the post text, images, and the user who created the post. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store post data.

Write tests to ensure that the post creation and deletion functionality works as expected.", "5. **Interacting with Posts:** Implement the functionality for interacting with posts. This involves creating a Comment dataclass with fields for the comment text, the user who created the comment, and the post the comment is associated with. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store comment data. Implement functionality for users to like, retweet, and reply to posts. Write tests to ensure that the post interaction functionality works as expected.", "6. **Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search functionality. This involves creating a Search function that takes a keyword and returns posts and users that match the keyword. Also, implement a Filter function that takes a hashtag, user mention, or trending topic and returns relevant posts. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search functionality works as expected.", "7. **Following & Followers:** Implement the following and followers functionality. This involves adding fields to the User dataclass for following and followers (both lists of User objects). Implement functionality for users to follow and unfollow other users. Also, implement a timeline view that displays posts from followed users. Write tests to ensure that the following and followers functionality works as expected.", "8. **Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging functionality. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for the message text, the sender, and the receiver. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store message data. Implement functionality for users to send messages to other users and to block/unblock users from messaging. Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging functionality works as expected.", "9. **Notifications:** Implement the notifications functionality. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for the notification text and the user who will receive the notification. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store notification data. Implement functionality for users to receive notifications for likes, retweets, replies, and mentions. Write tests to ensure that the notifications functionality works as expected.", "10. **Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending and discovery functionality. This involves creating a Trending function that identifies and displays trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. Also, implement a Recommendations function that recommends users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery functionality works as expected."], "step": "5. **Interacting with Posts:** Implement the functionality for interacting with posts.
