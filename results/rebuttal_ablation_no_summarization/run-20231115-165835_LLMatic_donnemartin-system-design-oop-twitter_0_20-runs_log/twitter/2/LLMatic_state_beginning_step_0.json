Create a new Python Flask project and set up the necessary files and directories. The project structure should include a main.py file which will serve as the entry point of the application, a models.py file for the data models, a views.py file for the routes and views, and a utils.py file for utility functions. Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage the project dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended for JWT authentication, and pytest for testing. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and that the necessary files and directories exist.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. In the models.py file, define a User data model with fields for email, username, and password. In the views.py file, create routes for user registration and login. The registration route should accept a POST request with the user's email, username, and password, create a new User instance, and save it to the in-memory database. The login route should accept a POST request with the user's email and password, verify the credentials, and return a JWT token. Use the Flask-JWT-Extended library to handle JWT authentication. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that user registration and login work correctly and that JWT authentication is properly set up.", "Step 3: Implement the profile management features. Add fields to the User model for profile picture, bio, website link, and location, and a boolean field for whether the profile is private or public. Create a route for editing the profile information. This route should accept a PUT request with the new profile information and the user's JWT token, verify the token, and update the user's profile information in the database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that profile editing works correctly and that the profile privacy setting is respected.", "Step 4: Implement the post creation and deletion features. Define a Post data model with fields for the post text, images, and the user who created the post. Create routes for creating and deleting posts. The create post route should accept a POST request with the post text, images, and the user's JWT token, create a new Post instance, and save it to the database. The delete post route should accept a DELETE request with the post ID and the user's JWT token, verify that the user is the creator of the post, and delete the post from the database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that post creation and deletion work correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the post interaction features. Add fields to the Post model for likes, retweets, and replies. Create routes for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts. These routes should accept POST requests with the post ID and the user's JWT token, update the corresponding field in the Post instance, and save the changes to the database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that post interactions work correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the content filtering and search features. Create a route for searching for posts or users. This route should accept a GET request with the search query and return a list of posts or users that match the query. Also, create a route for filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. This route should accept a GET request with the filter criteria and return a list of posts that match the criteria. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that search and filtering work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the following and followers features. Add fields to the User model for the users that the user is following and the users that are following the user. Create routes for following and unfollowing users. These routes should accept POST and DELETE requests respectively with the target user's ID and the user's JWT token, update the corresponding fields in the User instances, and save the changes to the database. Also, create a route for viewing the timeline, which should return a list of posts from the users that the user is following. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that following, unfollowing, and viewing the timeline work correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the direct messaging features. Define a Message data model with fields for the sender, the recipient, and the message text. Create routes for sending and viewing messages. The send message route should accept a POST request with the recipient's ID, the message text, and the user's JWT token, create a new Message instance, and save it to the database. The view messages route should accept a GET request with the user's JWT token and return a list of messages sent to or by the user. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that direct messaging works correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the notifications features. Define a Notification data model with fields for the user, the type of notification, and the related post or user. Create a route for viewing notifications. This route should accept a GET request with the user's JWT token and return a list of the user's notifications. Also, modify the post interaction and following routes to create notifications when a user likes, retweets, replies to, or follows another user. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that notifications work correctly.", "Step 10: Implement the trending topics and user recommendations features. Create a route for viewing trending topics. This route should calculate the most frequently mentioned hashtags or topics in recent posts and return a list of these topics. Also, create a route for viewing user recommendations. This route should suggest users to follow based on the user's interests, activity, and mutual followers. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that trending topics and user recommendations work correctly."], "step": "Step 1: Start by setting up the project structure and the necessary files.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
