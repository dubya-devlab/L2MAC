In the models.py file, define a User data model with fields for email, username, and password. In the views.py file, create routes for user registration and login. The registration route should accept a POST request with the user's email, username, and password, create a new User instance, and save it to the in-memory database. The login route should accept a POST request with the user's email and password, verify the credentials, and return a JWT token. Use the Flask-JWT-Extended library to handle JWT authentication.
