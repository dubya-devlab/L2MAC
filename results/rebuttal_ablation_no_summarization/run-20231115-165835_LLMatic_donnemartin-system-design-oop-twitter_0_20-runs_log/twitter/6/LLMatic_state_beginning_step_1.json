Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and the application runs without errors.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store user data. Implement the registration route (/register) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with user data (email, username, password), create a new User object, and store it in the mock database. Implement the authentication feature. This involves creating a login route (/login) that accepts POST requests with username and password, verifies the credentials against the mock database, and returns a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication features work as expected.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile information (profile picture, bio, website link, location, and privacy setting). Also, create a route (/profile) in the Flask application for managing user profiles. This route should accept GET requests to retrieve profile information and POST requests to update profile information. Write tests to ensure that the profile management feature works as expected.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass with fields for post content, author, timestamp, and optional image. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store post data. Implement the posting route (/post) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with post data (content, image), create a new Post object, and store it in the mock database. Implement the content management feature. This involves creating routes for liking posts (/like), retweeting posts (/retweet), and replying to posts (/reply). Each of these routes should accept POST requests with the relevant data (post ID, user ID) and update the mock database accordingly. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content management features work as expected.", "5. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves creating a route (/search) in the Flask application that accepts GET requests with a search query and returns posts or users that match the query. The search feature should support filtering by hashtags, user mentions, and trending topics. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search feature works as expected.", "6. **Implement Social Interaction:** Implement the social interaction features. This involves creating a Follow dataclass with fields for follower and followee, and a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store follow data. Implement the following route (/follow) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with follow data (follower, followee), create a new Follow object, and store it in the mock database. Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for sender, recipient, and content, and a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store message data. Implement the messaging route (/message) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with message data (sender, recipient, content), create a new Message object, and store it in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the social interaction features work as expected.", "7. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for recipient, type (like, retweet, reply, mention, follow), and related post or user. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store notification data. Implement the notifications route (/notifications) in the Flask application. This route should accept GET requests to retrieve notifications for a user and POST requests to create new notifications. Write tests to ensure that the notifications feature works as expected.", "8. **Implement Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending topics feature. This involves creating a route (/trending) in the Flask application that accepts GET requests and returns trending topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. The trending topics should be sortable based on location or globally. Implement the user recommendations feature. This involves creating a route (/recommendations) in the Flask application that accepts GET requests and returns user recommendations based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery features work as expected.", "9. **Implement Forgotten Password Reset:** Implement the forgotten password reset feature. This involves creating a route (/reset_password) in the Flask application that accepts POST requests with a user's email. The route should generate a password reset token and return it in the response. The user can then use this token to reset their password. Write tests to ensure that the forgotten password reset feature works as expected.", "10. **Final Testing and Refactoring:** After implementing all the features, perform a final round of testing to ensure that all features work together as expected. This involves running all the tests written in the previous steps and fixing any issues that arise. Also, refactor the code to improve its structure and readability. Finally, write a test to ensure that the entire application works as expected."], "step": "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store user data. Implement the registration route (/register) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with user data (email, username, password), create a new User object, and store it in the mock database. Implement the authentication feature. This involves creating a login route (/login) that accepts POST requests with username and password, verifies the credentials against the mock database, and returns a JWT token if the credentials are valid.
