Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage the project dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended for JWT authentication, Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM, and pytest for testing. Write tests to ensure that the project structure and the necessary files are set up correctly.", "Step 2: Design and implement the User model in the models.py file. The User model should have fields for id, email, username, password, profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Also, implement methods for password hashing and checking hashed passwords. Write tests to ensure that the User model is implemented correctly and that the password hashing and checking methods work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the registration and authentication features in the services.py file. The registration feature should allow users to register using email, username, and password. The authentication feature should use JWT for secure authentication. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication features work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the profile management feature in the services.py file. The profile management feature should allow users to edit their profile information and to make their profile private or public.

The posting feature should allow users to create text-based posts with a limit of 280 characters and to include images in posts. The content management feature should allow users to like, retweet, and reply to posts, and to search for specific posts or users using keywords. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content management features work as expected.", "Step 7: Design and implement the Follow model in the models.py file. The Follow model should have fields for follower_id and followed_id. Also, implement methods for following and unfollowing users.

The social interaction features should include following and unfollowing users, displaying a timeline view of posts from followed users, and receiving notifications for new followers. Write tests to ensure that the social interaction features work as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the trending and discovery features in the services.py file. The trending feature should identify and display trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. The discovery feature should recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery features work as expected.", "Step 10: Implement the routes and views in the views.py file.
