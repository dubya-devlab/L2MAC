Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage the project dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended for JWT authentication, Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM, and pytest for testing. Write tests to ensure that the project structure and the necessary files are set up correctly.", "Step 2: Design and implement the User model in the models.py file.

Write tests to ensure that the social interaction features work as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the trending and discovery features in the services.py file. The trending feature should identify and display trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. The discovery feature should recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
