Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly setup and that all dependencies are correctly installed.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication functionality. This includes creating a User dataclass to represent a user, and implementing the registration and login routes in the Flask application. The registration route should accept a POST request with the user's email, username, and password, create a new User object, and store it in an in-memory dictionary to mock a database. The login route should accept a POST request with the user's email and password, verify the credentials against the stored User objects, and return a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests to ensure that the registration and login routes work correctly, and that they correctly handle invalid input.", "3. **Password Reset:** Implement the password reset functionality. This includes creating a password reset route in the Flask application. The password reset route should accept a POST request with the user's email, generate a password reset token, and return it in the response. The password reset token should be a JWT token that includes the user's email and an expiration time. Also, implement a confirm password reset route that accepts a POST request with the password reset token and the new password, verifies the token, and updates the user's password. Write tests to ensure that the password reset functionality works correctly.", "4. **Profile Management:** Implement the profile management functionality. This includes creating a Profile dataclass to represent a user's profile, and implementing the edit profile route in the Flask application. The edit profile route should accept a POST request with the user's JWT token and the new profile information, verify the token, and update the user's profile. Write tests to ensure that the edit profile route works correctly, and that it correctly handles invalid input.", "5. **Creating and Deleting Posts:** Implement the functionality for creating and deleting posts. This includes creating a Post dataclass to represent a post, and implementing the create post and delete post routes in the Flask application. The create post route should accept a POST request with the user's JWT token and the post content, verify the token, create a new Post object, and store it in an in-memory dictionary to mock a database. The delete post route should accept a DELETE request with the user's JWT token and the post id, verify the token, and delete the corresponding Post object. Write tests to ensure that the create post and delete post routes work correctly, and that they correctly handle invalid input.", "6. **Interacting with Posts:** Implement the functionality for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts. This includes implementing the like post, retweet post, and reply to post routes in the Flask application. Each of these routes should accept a POST request with the user's JWT token and the post id, verify the token, and update the corresponding Post object. Write tests to ensure that these routes work correctly, and that they correctly handle invalid input.", "7. **Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the functionality for searching for posts and users, and for filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. This includes implementing the search route and the filter route in the Flask application. The search route should accept a GET request with a query parameter, and return a list of posts and users that match the query. The filter route should accept a GET request with a filter parameter, and return a list of posts that match the filter. Write tests to ensure that these routes work correctly, and that they correctly handle invalid input.", "8. **Following & Followers:** Implement the functionality for following and unfollowing users, and for viewing a timeline of posts from followed users. This includes implementing the follow user, unfollow user, and view timeline routes in the Flask application. Each of these routes should accept a POST or GET request with the user's JWT token and the other user's id (for the follow and unfollow routes) or no additional parameters (for the view timeline route), verify the token, and update the corresponding User objects or return a list of Post objects. Write tests to ensure that these routes work correctly, and that they correctly handle invalid input.", "9. **Direct Messaging:** Implement the functionality for sending and receiving direct messages. This includes creating a Message dataclass to represent a message, and implementing the send message and view messages routes in the Flask application. The send message route should accept a POST request with the user's JWT token, the recipient's id, and the message content, verify the token, create a new Message object, and store it in an in-memory dictionary to mock a database. The view messages route should accept a GET request with the user's JWT token, verify the token, and return a list of Message objects. Write tests to ensure that these routes work correctly, and that they correctly handle invalid input.", "10. **Trending & Discovery:** Implement the functionality for identifying and displaying trending topics, and for recommending users to follow. This includes implementing the trending topics and user recommendations routes in the Flask application. The trending topics route should accept a GET request and return a list of trending topics based on the posts in the in-memory dictionary. The user recommendations route should accept a GET request with the user's JWT token, verify the token, and return a list of recommended users based on the user's interests, activity, and mutual followers.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
