You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data.

This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up and that all dependencies are installed.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication system. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password, and methods for registering a new user and authenticating an existing user. The password should be hashed before being stored in the in-memory database. Use JWT for secure authentication. After implementing the user registration and authentication system, write tests to ensure that users can register, login, and that the password is correctly hashed.", "3. **User Profile Management:** Implement the user profile management system. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile picture, bio, website link, and location.

After implementing the system for creating posts, write tests to ensure that users can create and delete posts.", "5. **Interacting with Posts:** Implement the system for interacting with posts. This involves adding methods to the Post dataclass for liking, retweeting, and replying to a post. Also, implement a nested comment structure for post replies. After implementing the system for interacting with posts, write tests to ensure that users can like, retweet, and reply to posts, and that the nested comment structure works correctly.", "6. **Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search system. This involves adding methods to the Post dataclass for searching for specific posts or users using keywords, and filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. After implementing the content filtering and search system, write tests to ensure that users can search for specific posts or users, and filter posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics.", "7. **Following & Followers:** Implement the system for following and unfollowing users. This involves adding methods to the User dataclass for following and unfollowing other users, and displaying a timeline view of posts from followed users. Also, implement a notification system for new followers. After implementing the system for following and unfollowing users, write tests to ensure that users can follow and unfollow other users, view a timeline of posts from followed users, and receive notifications for new followers.", "8. **Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging system. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for the message's text, the sender, and the recipient. Also, add methods for sending a new message, and blocking and unblocking users. After implementing the direct messaging system, write tests to ensure that users can send messages, and block and unblock other users.", "9. **Notifications:** Implement the notification system. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for the notification's text and the user who will receive the notification.
