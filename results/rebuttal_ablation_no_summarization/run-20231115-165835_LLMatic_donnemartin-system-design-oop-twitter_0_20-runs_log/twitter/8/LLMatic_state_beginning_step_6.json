["1. **Setup the project structure and environment:** Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and the application runs without errors.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store user data. Implement the registration route (/register) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with user data (email, username, password), create a new User object, and store it in the mock database. Implement the authentication feature. This involves creating a login route (/login) that accepts POST requests with username and password, verifies the credentials against the mock database, and returns a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication features work as expected.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Also, create a route (/profile) in the Flask application for managing user profiles. This route should accept GET requests to retrieve the profile of the currently authenticated user, and PUT requests to update the profile. The PUT requests should accept the new profile data in the request body, update the User object in the mock database, and return the updated profile. Write tests to ensure that the profile management feature works as expected.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass with fields for post text, images, and user. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store post data. Implement a route (/posts) in the Flask application for creating and retrieving posts. This route should accept POST requests to create a new post, and GET requests to retrieve all posts. The POST requests should accept the post data in the request body, create a new Post object, and store it in the mock database. The GET requests should return all posts in the mock database. Implement the post interaction feature. This involves adding fields to the Post dataclass for likes, retweets, and replies, and updating the /posts route to handle these interactions. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content management features work as expected.", "5. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves creating a route (/search) in the Flask application that accepts GET requests with a query parameter for the search keyword. This route should return all posts and users in the mock databases that match the search keyword. Also, update the /posts route to accept optional query parameters for filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search feature works as expected.", "6. **Implement Social Interaction:** Implement the following and followers feature. This involves adding fields to the User dataclass for following and followers, and creating a route (/follow) in the Flask application for managing follow relationships. This route should accept POST requests to follow a user, and DELETE requests to unfollow a user. The requests should specify the username of the user to follow or unfollow. Also, update the /posts route to return only the posts from the followed users for the currently authenticated user. Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for sender, receiver, and text, a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store message data, and a route (/messages) in the Flask application for sending and retrieving messages. Write tests to ensure that the social interaction features work as expected.", "7. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for user, type, and post, a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store notification data, and a route (/notifications) in the Flask application for retrieving notifications. The /notifications route should return all notifications for the currently authenticated user. Also, update the /posts and /follow routes to create notifications when a post is liked, retweeted, replied to, or a user is followed. Write tests to ensure that the notifications feature works as expected.", "8. **Implement Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending topics feature. This involves creating a route (/trending) in the Flask application that returns the top trending hashtags or topics based on the volume and velocity of mentions in the posts in the mock database. Implement the user recommendations feature. This involves creating a route (/recommendations) in the Flask application that returns user recommendations based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery features work as expected.", "9. **Refactor and Optimize the Code:** After implementing all the features, refactor and optimize the code. This involves reviewing the code for any redundancies or inefficiencies, and refactoring it to improve readability, maintainability, and performance. Also, ensure that the code follows Python and Flask best practices, such as proper use of dataclasses, routes, and request handlers. Write tests to ensure that the refactoring and optimization does not break any of the features.", "10. **Final Testing and Verification:** Perform final testing and verification. This involves running all the tests to ensure that all features work as expected. Also, manually test the application by sending requests to the routes and verifying the responses. If any issues are found, debug and fix them. After all tests pass and the application works as expected, the implementation of the Online Microblogging Service is complete."], "step": "7. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature.
