Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. The project will have the following structure: `app.py` (main application file), `models.py` (contains the data models), `views.py` (handles the routes and views), `forms.py` (handles form validation), `utils.py` (contains utility functions), `tests/` (directory for test files). Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to manage Python dependencies. Install Flask, pytest, and other necessary libraries. Write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and run it using pytest.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication system. In `models.py`, define a User model with fields for email, username, and password. In `views.py`, create routes for user registration and login.

Write tests for user registration, login, and authentication, and run them using pytest.", "3. **Profile Management:** Implement the user profile management feature. Add fields to the User model for profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Create routes in `views.py` for viewing and editing user profiles. Implement form validation for profile edits. Add an option for users to make their profiles private or public. Write tests for profile viewing and editing, and run them using pytest.", "4. **Creating Posts (Tweets):** Implement the post creation feature.

Create a utility function in `utils.py` for searching posts and users based on keywords. Implement a filter option based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. Write tests for the search and filter features, and run them using pytest.", "7. **Following & Followers:** Implement the following and followers feature. Add fields to the User model for followers and following. Create routes in `views.py` for following and unfollowing users. Implement a timeline view that displays posts from followed users. Write tests for following, unfollowing, and the timeline view, and run them using pytest.", "8. **Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature. Define a Message model in `models.py` with fields for the sender, receiver, and message text. Create routes in `views.py` for sending and receiving messages.

Define a Notification model in `models.py` with fields for the user, the notification type (like, retweet, reply, mention), and the related post or message. Create routes in `views.py` for viewing notifications. Write tests for creating and viewing notifications, and run them using pytest.", "10. **Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending and discovery feature.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
