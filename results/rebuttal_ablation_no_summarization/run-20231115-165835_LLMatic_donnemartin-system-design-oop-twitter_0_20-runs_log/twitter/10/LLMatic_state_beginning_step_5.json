Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The main dependencies will be Flask, Pytest, and PyJWT. Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors. Run the test using Pytest.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication system. This will involve creating a User class with attributes for email, username, and password. The User class should also have methods for registering a new user, authenticating a user, and resetting a user's password. Use JWT for secure authentication. Write tests to ensure that the registration, authentication, and password reset functionalities work as expected. Run the tests using Pytest.", "3. **User Profile Management:** Implement the user profile management system. This will involve adding additional attributes to the User class for profile picture, bio, website link, and location.

Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging functionalities work as expected. Run the tests using Pytest.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Implement the notifications system. This will involve creating a Notification class with attributes for the notification's content and associated user. The Notification class should also have methods for creating a new notification (for likes, retweets, replies, and mentions). Write tests to ensure that the notifications functionalities work as expected. Run the tests using Pytest.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement the trending topics system. This will involve adding methods to the Post class for identifying and displaying trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions, and sorting trending topics based on location or globally. Write tests to ensure that the trending topics functionalities work as expected. Run the tests using Pytest.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Implement the user recommendations system.
