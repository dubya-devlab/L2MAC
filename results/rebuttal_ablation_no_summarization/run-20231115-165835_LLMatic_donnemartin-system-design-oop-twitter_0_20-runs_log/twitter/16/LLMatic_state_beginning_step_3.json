The `follow` and `unfollow` methods should update a `following` list and a `followers` list, and the `view_timeline` method should return a list of posts from users in the `following` list. After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for the following and followers functionalities. Run these tests using pytest.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Create a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender`, `receiver`, `text`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for sending a message (`send`) and blocking a user from sending messages (`block`). Use a dictionary to mock a database for storing message data.

The `receive_notification` method should add a notification to a `notifications` list. After implementing this method, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for the notifications functionality. Run these tests using pytest.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `get_trending_topics` function in a file named `trending.py`. This function should identify and return a list of trending hashtags or topics based on the volume and velocity of mentions. After implementing this function, write tests in a file named `test_trending.py` to ensure that the trending topics functionality works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Implement a `recommend_users` function in `trending.py`. This function should recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. After implementing this function, update the tests in `test_trending.py` to include tests for the user recommendations functionality. Run these tests using pytest."], "step": "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Add methods to the `Post` class for liking a post (`like`), retweeting a post (`retweet`), and replying to a post (`reply`).

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
