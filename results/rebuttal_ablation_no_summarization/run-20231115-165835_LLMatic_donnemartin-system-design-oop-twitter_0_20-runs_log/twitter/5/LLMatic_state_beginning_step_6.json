This class should have attributes for `email`, `username`, `password`, and `is_private` (for profile privacy). Implement methods for registering a new user and authenticating an existing user. The registration method should take in an email, username, and password, and create a new user. The authentication method should take in a username and password, and return the user if the credentials are correct. Also, implement a method for resetting a user's password. For this, you can simply update the user's password attribute. Remember to hash the passwords for security. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_user.py` to ensure that the registration, authentication, and password reset functionalities work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Add methods to the `User` class for editing a user's profile information. This includes updating the user's profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Also, implement a method for toggling the user's profile privacy. After implementing these methods, update your tests in `test_user.py` to ensure that the profile management functionalities work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "3. **Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Create a `Post` class in a file named `post.py`. This class should have attributes for `user` (the user who created the post), `text` (the content of the post), `image` (an optional image for the post), and `timestamp` (the time the post was created). Implement a method for creating a new post. This method should take in a user, text, and an optional image, and create a new post. Also, implement a method for deleting a post. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_post.py` to ensure that the post creation and deletion functionalities work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Add methods to the `Post` class for liking, retweeting, and replying to a post. For this, you can add `likes`, `retweets`, and `replies` attributes to the `Post` class, and increment/decrement these attributes in the respective methods. Also, implement a method for viewing a post's replies in a nested comment structure. After implementing these methods, update your tests in `test_post.py` to ensure that the post interaction functionalities work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "5. **Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement a `Search` class in a file named `search.py`. This class should have methods for searching for specific posts or users using keywords, and filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. For the search functionality, you can simply return the posts or users whose text or username contains the given keyword. For the filter functionality, you can return the posts that contain the given hashtag or user mention, or the posts that are part of the given trending topic. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_search.py` to ensure that the search and filter functionalities work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Add methods to the `User` class for following and unfollowing other users. For this, you can add `following` and `followers` attributes to the `User` class, and add/remove users to/from these attributes in the respective methods. Also, implement a method for viewing a user's timeline, which should display the posts from the users they are following. After implementing these methods, update your tests in `test_user.py` to ensure that the follow, unfollow, and timeline view functionalities work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Implement a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender`, `receiver`, `text`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for sending a new message and viewing a conversation thread. The send method should take in a sender, receiver, and text, and create a new message. The view thread method should return the messages between two users. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_message.py` to ensure that the direct messaging functionalities work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Add methods to the `User` class for notifying a user of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions. For this, you can add a `notifications` attribute to the `User` class, and add notifications to this attribute in the respective methods. A notification can be a simple string that describes the event (e.g., 'User X liked your post'). After implementing these methods, update your tests in `test_user.py` to ensure that the notification functionalities work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `Trending` class in a file named `trending.py`. This class should have a method for identifying and displaying trending topics based on the volume and velocity of mentions. For this, you can simply return the hashtags that appear the most in the recent posts. After implementing this method, write tests in a file named `test_trending.py` to ensure that the trending topics functionality works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Add a method to the `User` class for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. For this, you can simply return the users who have the most mutual followers with the given user, and who have similar interests and activity (e.g., they post about similar topics). After implementing this method, update your tests in `test_user.py` to ensure that the user recommendation functionality works as expected. Run these tests using pytest."], "step": "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Implement a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`.
