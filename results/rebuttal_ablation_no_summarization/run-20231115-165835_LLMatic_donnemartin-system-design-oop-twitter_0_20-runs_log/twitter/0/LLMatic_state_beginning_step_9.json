named `user.py`. This class should have attributes for `email`, `username`, `password`, and `is_private` (for profile privacy). Implement methods for registering a new user (`register`), authenticating a user (`authenticate`), and resetting a user's password (`reset_password`). Use a dictionary to mock a database for storing user data. The `register` method should check if a user with the given email or username already exists before adding a new user. The `authenticate` method should verify the user's credentials. The `reset_password` method should update the user's password. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_user.py` to verify that the `User` class methods work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Extend the `User` class by adding attributes for `profile_picture`, `bio`, `website_link`, and `location`. Implement methods for editing these profile attributes (`edit_profile`). The `edit_profile` method should update the user's profile information. After implementing this method, write tests in `test_user.py` to verify that the `edit_profile` method works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "3. **Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Create a `Post` class in a file named `post.py`. This class should have attributes for `user`, `text`, `image`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for creating a new post (`create_post`) and deleting a post (`delete_post`). The `create_post` method should create a new post and add it to a mock database (a dictionary). The `delete_post` method should remove a post from the mock database. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_post.py` to verify that the `Post` class methods work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Extend the `Post` class by adding methods for liking a post (`like_post`), retweeting a post (`retweet`), and replying to a post (`reply`). The `like_post` method should increment a `likes` counter for the post. The `retweet` method should add the post to the user's `retweets` list. The `reply` method should add a reply to the post's `replies` list. After implementing these methods, write tests in `test_post.py` to verify that these new `Post` class methods work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "5. **Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement a `search` function in `post.py` that takes a keyword as input and returns a list of posts that contain the keyword in their text. Implement a `filter_posts` function that takes a hashtag or user mention as input and returns a list of posts that contain the hashtag or user mention. After implementing these functions, write tests in `test_post.py` to verify that the `search` and `filter_posts` functions work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Extend the `User` class by adding a `follow` method that adds another user to the user's `following` list, and a `unfollow` method that removes a user from the `following` list. Implement a `get_timeline` method that returns a list of posts from users that the user is following. After implementing these methods, write tests in `test_user.py` to verify that these new `User` class methods work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Create a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender`, `receiver`, `text`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for sending a message (`send_message`) and blocking a user (`block_user`). The `send_message` method should add a message to a mock database (a dictionary). The `block_user` method should add a user to the user's `blocked_users` list. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_message.py` to verify that the `Message` class methods work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Extend the `User` class by adding a `notifications` list attribute. Implement a `notify` method that adds a notification to the user's `notifications` list. This method should be called whenever a user receives a like, retweet, reply, or mention. After implementing this method, write tests in `test_user.py` to verify that the `notify` method works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `get_trending_topics` function in `post.py` that returns a list of the most frequently mentioned hashtags in the posts. After implementing this function, write tests in `test_post.py` to verify that the `get_trending_topics` function works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Implement a `recommend_users` function in `user.py` that recommends users for a user to follow based on shared interests (common hashtags in posts), activity (number of posts), and mutual followers. After implementing this function, write tests in `test_user.py` to verify that the `recommend_users` function works as expected. Run these tests using pytest."], "step": "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Implement a `recommend_users` function in `user.py` that recommends users for a user to follow based on shared interests (common hashtags in posts), activity (number of posts), and mutual followers.
