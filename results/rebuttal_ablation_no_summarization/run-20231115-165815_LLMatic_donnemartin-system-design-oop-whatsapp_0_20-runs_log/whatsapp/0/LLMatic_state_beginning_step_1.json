This includes the main application file (app.py), a file for user management (user.py), a file for message management (message.py), a file for group management (group.py), and a file for status management (status.py). Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that all files are created successfully and can be imported without any issues.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes sign up using email and forgotten password recovery. In the user.py file, create a User class with methods for registering a new user and recovering a forgotten password. Use an in-memory dictionary to store user data. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a user can register and recover their password successfully.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes allowing users to set profile pictures and status messages, and privacy settings for who can see user details or last seen status. Add methods to the User class for setting a profile picture, setting a status message, and updating privacy settings. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a user can update their profile and privacy settings successfully.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes blocking/unblocking contacts and creating, editing, and managing groups. In the user.py file, add methods to the User class for blocking and unblocking contacts. In the group.py file, create a Group class with methods for creating, editing, and managing groups. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a user can block/unblock contacts and manage groups successfully.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes sending and receiving real-time text messages, message read receipts, end-to-end encryption for security, image sharing, and support for emojis, GIFs, and stickers. In the message.py file, create a Message class with methods for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting and decrypting messages, and handling image and emoji/GIF/sticker messages. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that messages can be sent and received successfully, read receipts are updated correctly, messages are encrypted and decrypted correctly, and image and emoji/GIF/sticker messages are handled correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating group chats with a name and picture, adding or removing participants, and admin roles and permissions. Add methods to the Group class for creating a group chat, adding and removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that group chats can be created and managed successfully.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes allowing users to post image statuses visible for a limited time and controlling who can see the status. In the status.py file, create a Status class with methods for posting a status, setting the visibility duration, and updating the visibility settings. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that statuses can be posted and managed successfully.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes making the chat service accessible from browsers. In the app.py file, set up a Flask application and define routes for the various features of the chat service. After implementing the web application, write tests to ensure that the application runs successfully and all routes are accessible.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes message queuing for when the user is offline (messages are sent once connectivity is restored) and displaying online/offline status. Add methods to the User and Message classes for handling offline messages and updating online/offline status. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that offline messages are queued and sent successfully, and online/offline status is updated correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire codebase to ensure that all features have been implemented correctly and all tests pass. If any issues are found, debug and fix them. After all tests pass, the implementation of the Global Chat Service is complete."], "step": "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
