setting up the basic structure of the application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The dictionary should have keys as user IDs and values as another dictionary containing user details such as email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and the 'users' dictionary is initialized as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept user details, generate a unique user ID, and store the details in the 'users' dictionary. The forgotten password recovery route should accept a user ID and return the corresponding password from the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the sign up and password recovery routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. These routes should accept a user ID and the new details, and update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the profile update routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking/unblocking contacts and managing groups. The block/unblock routes should accept a user ID and a contact ID, and update the blocked contacts list for the user in the 'users' dictionary. The group management routes should accept a user ID and group details, and update the groups list for the user in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the contact management routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. These routes should accept relevant details and perform the necessary actions. Since we cannot persist data, you can simulate these actions by printing relevant messages. Write tests to ensure that the messaging routes work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding/removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. These routes should accept relevant details and update the groups list in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the group chat routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and updating status visibility settings. These routes should accept relevant details and perform the necessary actions. Since we cannot persist data, you can simulate these actions by printing relevant messages. Write tests to ensure that the status/story routes work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a route for accessing the application from a browser. This route should return a simple HTML page that represents the application. Write tests to ensure that the web application route works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a route for updating the online/offline status of a user and a mechanism for queuing messages when a user is offline. The online/offline status route should accept a user ID and a status, and update the corresponding entry in the 'users' dictionary. The message queuing mechanism can be simulated by printing relevant messages. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire application and make any necessary improvements. This includes optimizing the code, improving error handling, and enhancing the user experience. Also, write comprehensive tests for the entire application to ensure that all features work together as expected."], "step": "Step 6: Implement the group chat features.
