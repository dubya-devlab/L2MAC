This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'models' directory to hold the data models for the application. The models will include User, Message, Group, and Status. Each model will have its own file in the 'models' directory. The User model will have fields for email, password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. The Message model will have fields for sender, receiver, content, read receipt, and encryption. The Group model will have fields for name, picture, participants, and admin roles. The Status model will have fields for user, content, visibility, and time limit. After setting up the basic structure and models, write tests to ensure that the models are correctly set up and can be created, read, updated, and deleted.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should take an email and password, create a new User model, and save it. The forgotten password recovery route should take an email, generate a password reset link, and send it to the email. Implement these features in the main application file (app.py). After implementing user registration and authentication, write tests to ensure that users can sign up and recover their passwords.", "Step 3: Implement user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. The profile picture route should take a file upload, save it, and update the User model. The status message route should take a string, and update the User model. The privacy settings route should take a boolean, and update the User model. Implement these features in the main application file (app.py). After implementing user profile features, write tests to ensure that users can set profile pictures, status messages, and update their privacy settings.", "Step 4: Implement contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and creating, editing, and managing groups. The block/unblock routes should take a user id, and update the User model. The group routes should take a name, picture, participants, and admin roles, create a new Group model, and save it. Implement these features in the main application file (app.py). After implementing contact management features, write tests to ensure that users can block/unblock contacts, and create, edit, and manage groups.", "Step 5: Implement messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. The send/receive routes should take a sender, receiver, and content, create a new Message model, and save it. The read receipt route should take a message id, and update the Message model. The encryption route should take a message id, encrypt the content, and update the Message model. The image sharing route should take a file upload, save it, and update the Message model. Implement these features in the main application file (app.py). After implementing messaging features, write tests to ensure that users can send/receive messages, update read receipts, encrypt messages, and share images.", "Step 6: Implement group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding/removing participants, and updating admin roles. The create group chat route should take a name, picture, participants, and admin roles, create a new Group model, and save it. The add/remove participants route should take a group id and user id, and update the Group model. The admin roles route should take a group id, user id, and role, and update the Group model. Implement these features in the main application file (app.py). After implementing group chat features, write tests to ensure that users can create group chats, add/remove participants, and update admin roles.", "Step 7: Implement status/story features. This includes creating routes for posting statuses, and updating status visibility. The post status route should take a user id, content, and time limit, create a new Status model, and save it. The status visibility route should take a status id, and update the Status model. Implement these features in the main application file (app.py). After implementing status/story features, write tests to ensure that users can post statuses, and update status visibility.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a 'templates' directory to hold the HTML templates for the application, and creating routes for each page of the application. The routes should render the corresponding HTML template. Implement these features in the main application file (app.py). After implementing the web application, write tests to ensure that the application can be accessed from a browser and that each page renders correctly.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a message queue for when the user is offline, and creating a route to display the online/offline status. The message queue should store messages when the user is offline, and send them when the user is online. The online/offline status route should take a user id, and return the online/offline status. Implement these features in the main application file (app.py). After implementing connectivity and offline mode features, write tests to ensure that messages are queued when the user is offline, sent when the user is online, and that the online/offline status is correctly displayed.", "Step 10: Finally, create a requirements.txt file to list all the Python packages used in the application.
