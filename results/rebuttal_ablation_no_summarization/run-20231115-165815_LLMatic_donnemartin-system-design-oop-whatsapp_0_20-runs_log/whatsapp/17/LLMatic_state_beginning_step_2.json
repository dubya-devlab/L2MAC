The project will be divided into several modules: `auth`, `profile`, `contacts`, `messaging`, `groups`, `status`, `webapp`, and `connectivity`. Each module will contain the necessary classes and functions to implement the features related to that module. For instance, the `auth` module will contain classes and functions for user registration and authentication, the `profile` module for user profile management, and so on. Create a `main.py` file that will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the Python packages that will be used in the project. At this stage, write a test to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up and that all the necessary files are present.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This will involve creating a `User` class in the `auth` module, with methods for signing up and password recovery. The `User` class will also need to have a method for validating user credentials. Use an in-memory dictionary to mock a database for storing user data. Write tests to ensure that the user registration, authentication, and password recovery features work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This will involve creating a `Profile` class in the `profile` module, with methods for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for managing privacy settings. The `Profile` class will be associated with the `User` class from the `auth` module. Write tests to ensure that the user profile features work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This will involve creating a `Contact` class in the `contacts` module, with methods for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for managing groups. The `Contact` class will be associated with the `User` class from the `auth` module. Write tests to ensure that the contact management features work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This will involve creating a `Message` class in the `messaging` module, with methods for sending and receiving text messages, managing read receipts, encrypting messages, sharing images, and supporting emojis, GIFs, and stickers. The `Message` class will be associated with the `User` and `Contact` classes from the `auth` and `contacts` modules, respectively. Write tests to ensure that the messaging features work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This will involve creating a `Group` class in the `groups` module, with methods for creating group chats, managing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The `Group` class will be associated with the `User` and `Contact` classes from the `auth` and `contacts` modules, respectively. Write tests to ensure that the group chat features work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This will involve creating a `Status` class in the `status` module, with methods for posting image statuses and managing who can see the status. The `Status` class will be associated with the `User` class from the `auth` module. Write tests to ensure that the status/story feature works as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This will involve creating a `WebApp` class in the `webapp` module, with methods for rendering the chat application in a web browser. The `WebApp` class will be associated with all the other classes from the other modules. Write tests to ensure that the web application feature works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This will involve creating a `Connectivity` class in the `connectivity` module, with methods for managing message queuing when the user is offline and for displaying online/offline status. The `Connectivity` class will be associated with the `User` and `Message` classes from the `auth` and `messaging` modules, respectively. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, integrate all the modules in the `main.py` file. This will involve creating instances of the classes from the different modules and calling their methods to simulate the operation of the chat application. Write tests to ensure that all the features of the chat application work together as expected."], "step": "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This will involve creating a `Profile` class in the `profile` module, with methods for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for managing privacy settings. The `Profile` class will be associated with the `User` class from the `auth` module.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
