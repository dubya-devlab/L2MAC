application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. This dictionary should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database can store and retrieve user data correctly.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for user sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept an email and password, and store this information in the mock database. The forgotten password recovery route should accept an email, verify that this email exists in the database, and then return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the sign up and forgotten password recovery routes work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement user profile functionality. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept an email and the new profile picture or status message, update the corresponding user's information in the database, and then return a success message. The privacy settings route should accept an email and the new privacy settings, update the corresponding user's information in the database, and then return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings routes work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement contact management functionality. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept two emails (the user's email and the contact's email), update the user's information in the database accordingly, and then return a success message. The group routes should accept a group name and a list of emails, update the database accordingly, and then return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the block, unblock, and group routes work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement messaging functionality. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving real-time text messages, for updating message read receipts, for encrypting and decrypting messages, and for sharing images. The message routes should accept two emails (the sender's email and the receiver's email), a message, update the database accordingly, and then return a success message. The read receipt, encryption, decryption, and image sharing routes should work similarly. Write tests to ensure that the message, read receipt, encryption, decryption, and image sharing routes work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement group chat functionality. This includes creating routes for creating group chats with a name and picture, for adding or removing participants, and for updating admin roles and permissions. The group chat, participant, and admin routes should accept a group name and a list of emails, update the database accordingly, and then return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the group chat, participant, and admin routes work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses visible for a limited time, and for controlling who can see the status. The status routes should accept an email, an image, and a visibility setting, update the database accordingly, and then return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the status routes work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement web application functionality. This includes creating a web-based version of the application that is accessible from browsers. This can be done by creating HTML templates for the different pages of the application, and then rendering these templates in the appropriate routes. Write tests to ensure that the web application works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode functionality. This includes creating a message queuing system for when the user is offline, and for displaying online/offline status. The message queuing system should store messages in a queue when the receiver is offline, and then send these messages once the receiver is online. The online/offline status should be updated in the database whenever a user logs in or out. Write tests to ensure that the message queuing system and the online/offline status updates work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive test of the entire application. This includes testing all routes, all database operations, and all edge cases. Make sure that all tests pass and that the application works as expected. If any issues are found, debug and fix them, and then re-run the tests until all tests pass."], "step": "Step 5: Implement messaging functionality. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving real-time text messages, for updating message read receipts, for encrypting and decrypting messages, and for sharing images.
