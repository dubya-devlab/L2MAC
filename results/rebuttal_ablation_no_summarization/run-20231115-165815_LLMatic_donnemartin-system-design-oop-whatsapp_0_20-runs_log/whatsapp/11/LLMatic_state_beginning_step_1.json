This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The database should have tables for users, messages, groups, and statuses. Each table should be a dictionary where the key is the unique identifier for the record (e.g., user ID, message ID, etc.) and the value is another dictionary containing the record's data. Write tests to ensure that the database can correctly store and retrieve data.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating endpoints for user registration (sign up) and forgotten password recovery. The sign-up endpoint should accept an email and password, create a new user in the database, and return a success message. The forgotten password recovery endpoint should accept an email, generate a temporary password, update the user's password in the database, and return the temporary password. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work correctly and that the password is updated correctly in the database.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating endpoints for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message endpoints should accept a user ID and the new picture or message, update the user's record in the database, and return a success message. The privacy settings endpoint should accept a user ID and the new settings, update the user's record in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work correctly and that the user's record is updated correctly in the database.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating endpoints for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block/unblock endpoints should accept a user ID and the ID of the contact to block or unblock, update the user's record in the database, and return a success message. The group management endpoints should accept a group ID and the new group data, update the group's record in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work correctly and that the user's and group's records are updated correctly in the database.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating endpoints for sending and receiving messages, for updating message read receipts, and for sending images. The send message endpoint should accept a sender ID, a recipient ID, and the message content, create a new message in the database, and return a success message. The receive message endpoint should accept a recipient ID, retrieve all unread messages for the recipient from the database, mark them as read, and return them. The read receipt endpoint should accept a message ID, update the message's record in the database to indicate that it has been read, and return a success message. The send image endpoint should accept a sender ID, a recipient ID, and the image data, create a new message in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work correctly and that the messages are stored and updated correctly in the database.", "Step 6: Implement group chats. This includes creating endpoints for creating group chats, for adding and removing participants, and for managing admin roles and permissions. The create group chat endpoint should accept a name and picture, create a new group in the database, and return the group ID. The add/remove participant endpoints should accept a group ID and a user ID, update the group's record in the database, and return a success message. The admin management endpoint should accept a group ID and the new admin data, update the group's record in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work correctly and that the groups are stored and updated correctly in the database.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating endpoints for posting image statuses and for updating who can see the status. The post status endpoint should accept a user ID and the image data, create a new status in the database, and return a success message. The update visibility endpoint should accept a status ID and the new visibility data, update the status's record in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work correctly and that the statuses are stored and updated correctly in the database.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a static folder for serving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and setting up Flask to serve these files. Also, create a basic HTML page for the chat application. Write tests to ensure that the static files are served correctly.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a message queue for each user in the database to store messages that are sent when the user is offline. The send message endpoint should add the message to the recipient's queue if the recipient is offline. The receive message endpoint should return all messages in the user's queue and clear the queue. Write tests to ensure that the message queues work correctly and that messages are stored and delivered correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive test of the entire application. This includes testing all endpoints, database operations, and offline mode functionality. Fix any bugs that are found and retest to ensure that all features work correctly."], "step": "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating endpoints for user registration (sign up) and forgotten password recovery. The sign-up endpoint should accept an email and password, create a new user in the database, and return a success message. The forgotten password recovery endpoint should accept an email, generate a temporary password, update the user's password in the database, and return the temporary password.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
