Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies. Write a test to ensure that all files are created successfully and that the project structure is correct.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication system. This includes functions for signing up with an email (sign_up), logging in (log_in), and password recovery (recover_password). The user data should be stored in a dictionary acting as a mock database. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication system works correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile management system. This includes functions for setting profile pictures (set_profile_picture), setting status messages (set_status_message), and managing privacy settings (manage_privacy_settings). Write tests to ensure that the user profile management system works correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management system. This includes functions for blocking and unblocking contacts (block_contact, unblock_contact), and for creating, editing, and managing groups (create_group, edit_group, manage_group). Write tests to ensure that the contact management system works correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging system. This includes functions for sending and receiving real-time text messages (send_message, receive_message), managing read receipts (manage_read_receipts), encrypting messages (encrypt_message), sharing images (share_image), and supporting emojis, GIFs, and stickers (support_emojis_gifs_stickers). Write tests to ensure that the messaging system works correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat system. This includes functions for creating group chats with a name and picture (create_group_chat), adding or removing participants (add_participant, remove_participant), and managing admin roles and permissions (manage_admin_roles). Write tests to ensure that the group chat system works correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes functions for posting image statuses visible for a limited time (post_status), and controlling who can see the status (control_status_visibility). Write tests to ensure that the status/story feature works correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes setting up a Flask server in the main application file (app.py), and creating routes for all the functions implemented in the previous steps. Write tests to ensure that the web application works correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode. This includes functions for queuing messages when the user is offline (queue_message), and displaying online/offline status (display_status). Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode works correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, run all the tests written in the previous steps to ensure that all parts of the application work correctly.
