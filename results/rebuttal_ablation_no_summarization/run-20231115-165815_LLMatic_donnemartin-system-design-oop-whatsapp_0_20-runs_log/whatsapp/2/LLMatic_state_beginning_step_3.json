Write tests to ensure that the group chat system works correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes functions for posting image statuses visible for a limited time (post_status), and controlling who can see the status (control_status_visibility). Write tests to ensure that the status/story feature works correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes setting up a Flask server in the main application file (app.py), and creating routes for all the functions implemented in the previous steps. Write tests to ensure that the web application works correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode. This includes functions for queuing messages when the user is offline (queue_message), and displaying online/offline status (display_status). Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode works correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, run all the tests written in the previous steps to ensure that all parts of the application work correctly.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
