Start by setting up the basic structure of the application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. This dictionary should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database can store and retrieve user data correctly.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for user sign up and forgotten password recovery. For sign up, the route should accept user email and password, and store this information in the mock database. For password recovery, the route should accept user email and send a password reset link (for the purpose of this task, just return a message indicating that the link has been sent). Write tests to ensure that the sign up and password recovery routes work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement user profile functionality. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept the relevant data and update the user's information in the mock database. The privacy settings route should accept the new settings and update them in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that these routes work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement contact management functionality. This includes creating routes for blocking/unblocking contacts and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block/unblock routes should accept the contact's email and update the user's blocked contacts list in the mock database. The group routes should accept the group details and update the user's groups list in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that these routes work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement messaging functionality. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, for updating read receipts, and for sharing images. The send/receive routes should accept the message details and update the user's messages list in the mock database. The read receipt route should accept the message ID and update the message's read status in the mock database. The image sharing route should accept the image data and update the message's content in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that these routes work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement group chat functionality. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, for adding/removing participants, and for updating admin roles and permissions. The create group chat route should accept the group details and update the user's groups list in the mock database. The add/remove participants route should accept the participant's email and update the group's participants list in the mock database. The admin roles route should accept the new roles and permissions and update them in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that these routes work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and for updating who can see the status. The post status route should accept the image data and update the user's statuses list in the mock database. The status visibility route should accept the visibility settings and update them in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that these routes work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement web application functionality. This includes creating a basic HTML/CSS/JS frontend that interacts with the Flask backend. The frontend should have pages for sign up, sign in, profile, contacts, messages, groups, and statuses. Write tests to ensure that the frontend can successfully send requests to the backend and display the returned data.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode functionality. This includes creating a message queue for when the user is offline, and a route for updating the user's online/offline status. The message queue should store messages that are sent while the user is offline, and send them once the user is online again. The online/offline status route should accept the new status and update it in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that these features work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive test of the entire application. This includes testing all routes, all database operations, and all frontend pages. Fix any bugs that are found, and ensure that all tests pass. Also, write a README file that explains how to run the application and its tests."], "step": "Step 6: Implement group chat functionality. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, for adding/removing participants, and for updating admin roles and permissions. The create group chat route should accept the group details and update the user's groups list in the mock database.

The admin roles route should accept the new roles and permissions and update them in the mock database.
