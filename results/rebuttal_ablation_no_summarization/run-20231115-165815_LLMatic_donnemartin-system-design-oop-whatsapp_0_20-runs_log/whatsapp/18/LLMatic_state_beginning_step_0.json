This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. This dictionary should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the application setup is correct and the mock database can store and retrieve data correctly.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept an email and password, and store this information in the mock database. The forgotten password recovery route should accept an email, verify that the email exists in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication routes work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept an email and the new picture or message, and update the corresponding user's information in the database. The privacy settings route should accept an email and the new settings, and update the corresponding user's information in the database. Write tests to ensure that the profile management routes work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept two emails, and update the corresponding user's blocked contacts list in the database. The group management routes should accept an email, a group name, and a list of contacts, and update the corresponding user's groups in the database. Write tests to ensure that the contact management routes work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. The send and receive routes should accept two emails and a message, and update the corresponding users' message lists in the database. The read receipt route should accept two emails and a message, and update the corresponding message's read status in the database. The encryption route should accept a message, encrypt it, and return the encrypted message. The image sharing route should accept two emails and an image, and update the corresponding users' message lists in the database. Write tests to ensure that the messaging routes work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating groups, adding and removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The create group route should accept an email, a group name, and a list of participants, and create a new group in the database. The add and remove participants routes should accept an email, a group name, and a participant email, and update the corresponding group's participant list in the database. The admin roles and permissions route should accept an email, a group name, and a list of admin emails, and update the corresponding group's admin list in the database. Write tests to ensure that the group chat routes work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting statuses, and managing who can see the status. The post status route should accept an email, a status, and a visibility list, and update the corresponding user's status in the database. The visibility management route should accept an email, a status, and a visibility list, and update the corresponding status's visibility list in the database. Write tests to ensure that the status/story routes work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend that interacts with the Flask backend. The frontend should have pages for sign up, sign in, profile management, contact management, messaging, group chats, and status/story. Write tests to ensure that the frontend can successfully send requests to the backend and display the returned data.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a route for updating online/offline status, and a system for queuing messages when the user is offline. The online/offline status route should accept an email and a status, and update the corresponding user's online status in the database. The message queuing system should store messages in a queue when the recipient is offline, and send them when the recipient comes online. Write tests to ensure that the online/offline status route and the message queuing system work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive test of the entire application. This includes testing all routes, the frontend, and the message queuing system. Fix any bugs that are found, and ensure that all tests pass. Once all tests pass, the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "Step 1: Start by setting up the basic structure of the application.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
