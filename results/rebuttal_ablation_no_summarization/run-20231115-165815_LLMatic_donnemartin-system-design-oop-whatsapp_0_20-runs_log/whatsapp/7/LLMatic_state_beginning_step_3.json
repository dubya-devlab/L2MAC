application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The database should have tables for users, messages, groups, and statuses. Each table should be a dictionary where the key is the unique identifier for the record (e.g., user ID, message ID, etc.) and the value is another dictionary containing the record's data. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database can store and retrieve data correctly.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating endpoints for user registration (sign up) and forgotten password recovery. The sign-up endpoint should accept an email and password, create a new user record in the database, and return a success message. The forgotten password recovery endpoint should accept an email, generate a password recovery link, and return the link. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the endpoints work as expected and that the user data is stored correctly in the database.", "Step 3: Implement user profile features. This includes creating endpoints for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message endpoints should accept a user ID and the new picture or message, update the user's record in the database, and return a success message. The privacy settings endpoint should accept a user ID and the new settings, update the user's record in the database, and return a success message. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the endpoints work as expected and that the user data is updated correctly in the database.", "Step 4: Implement contact management features. This includes creating endpoints for blocking/unblocking contacts and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block/unblock contacts endpoint should accept a user ID and the ID of the contact to block/unblock, update the user's record in the database, and return a success message. The group management endpoints should accept a group ID and the new group data, update the group's record in the database, and return a success message. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the endpoints work as expected and that the user and group data is updated correctly in the database.", "Step 5: Implement messaging features. This includes creating endpoints for sending and receiving messages, for updating message read receipts, for encrypting messages, and for sharing images. The send/receive messages endpoint should accept a message, store it in the database, and return a success message. The read receipts endpoint should accept a message ID, update the message's record in the database, and return a success message. The encryption endpoint should accept a message, encrypt it, and return the encrypted message. The image sharing endpoint should accept an image, store it in the database, and return a success message. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the endpoints work as expected and that the message and image data is stored correctly in the database.", "Step 6: Implement group chat features. This includes creating endpoints for creating group chats, for adding/removing participants, and for managing admin roles and permissions. The create group chat endpoint should accept a group name and picture, create a new group record in the database, and return a success message. The add/remove participants endpoint should accept a group ID and the ID of the participant to add/remove, update the group's record in the database, and return a success message. The admin roles and permissions endpoint should accept a group ID and the new admin data, update the group's record in the database, and return a success message. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the endpoints work as expected and that the group data is updated correctly in the database.", "Step 7: Implement status/story features. This includes creating endpoints for posting image statuses and for controlling who can see the status. The post status endpoint should accept a user ID and an image, create a new status record in the database, and return a success message. The status visibility endpoint should accept a status ID and the visibility settings, update the status's record in the database, and return a success message. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the endpoints work as expected and that the status data is stored and updated correctly in the database.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a web interface for the chat application using Flask's templating engine. The web interface should include pages for user registration, user profile management, contact management, messaging, group chats, and status/story posting. After implementing the web interface, write tests to ensure that the pages load correctly and that the user can interact with the application through the web interface.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a message queuing system for when the user is offline and displaying the user's online/offline status. The message queuing system should store messages in a queue when the user is offline and send them when the user comes online. The online/offline status should be displayed on the user's profile page. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the message queuing system works correctly and that the online/offline status is displayed correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application. This includes running all the tests written in the previous steps and ensuring that they all pass. Also, perform manual testing of the application by interacting with it through the web interface and checking that all features work as expected. If any issues are found, debug and fix them, and then re-run the tests to ensure that the fixes work correctly."], "step": "Step 4: Implement contact management features. This includes creating endpoints for blocking/unblocking contacts and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block/unblock contacts endpoint should accept a user ID and the ID of the contact to block/unblock, update the user's record in the database, and return a success message. The group management endpoints should accept a group ID and the new group data, update the group's record in the database, and return a success message. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the endpoints work as expected and that the user and group data is updated correctly in the database.", "meta_messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\nObjective: Write code for a large system design task.\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional.
