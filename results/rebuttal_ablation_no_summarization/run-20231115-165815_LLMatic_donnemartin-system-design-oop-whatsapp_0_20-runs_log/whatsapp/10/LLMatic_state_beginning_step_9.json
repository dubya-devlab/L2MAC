by setting up the basic structure of the application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. This dictionary should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the application setup is correct and the mock database can store and retrieve data correctly.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept an email and password, and store this information in the mock database. The forgotten password recovery route should accept an email, verify that the email exists in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication routes work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept an email and the new picture or message, and update this information in the database. The privacy settings route should accept an email and the new settings, and update this information in the database. Write tests to ensure that the profile management routes work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept two emails (the user's email and the contact's email), and update the user's blocked contacts list in the database. The group management routes should accept an email, a group name, and a list of contacts, and update the user's groups in the database. Write tests to ensure that the contact management routes work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. The send and receive routes should accept two emails (the sender's email and the receiver's email), a message, and a timestamp, and update the messages in the database. The read receipts route should accept two emails and a message, and update the message's read status in the database. The encryption route should accept a message and return the encrypted message. The image sharing route should accept two emails, an image, and a timestamp, and update the messages in the database. Write tests to ensure that the messaging routes work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating groups, adding and removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The create group route should accept an email, a group name, a picture, and a list of participants, and update the groups in the database. The add and remove participants routes should accept an email, a group name, and a participant's email, and update the group's participants in the database. The admin roles and permissions route should accept an email, a group name, and a list of admins, and update the group's admins in the database. Write tests to ensure that the group chat routes work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting statuses and controlling who can see the status. The post status route should accept an email, an image, and a timestamp, and update the statuses in the database. The status visibility route should accept an email, a status, and a list of contacts, and update the status's visibility in the database. Write tests to ensure that the status/story routes work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a static folder for serving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and setting up Flask to serve these files. Write tests to ensure that the web application serves files correctly.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a route for updating the online/offline status, and updating the message queuing system to store messages when the user is offline and send them when the user is online. The online/offline status route should accept an email and a status, and update the user's online status in the database. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, run all tests to ensure that all features of the application work as expected. If any tests fail, debug the corresponding feature and rerun the tests until all tests pass."], "step": "Step 10: Finally, run all tests to ensure that all features of the application work as expected.
