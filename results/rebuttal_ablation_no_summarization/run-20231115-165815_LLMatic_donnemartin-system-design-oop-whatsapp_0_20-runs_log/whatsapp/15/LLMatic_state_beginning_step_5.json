This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. This dictionary should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the application setup is correct and the mock database can store and retrieve data correctly.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept an email and password, and store this information in the mock database. The forgotten password recovery route should accept an email, verify that the email exists in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the sign up and forgotten password recovery routes work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept an email and the new profile picture or status message, update the corresponding user's information in the database, and return a success message. The privacy settings route should accept an email and the new privacy settings, update the corresponding user's information in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the profile management routes work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept two emails (the user's email and the contact's email), update the user's blocked contacts list in the database, and return a success message. The group management routes should accept a group name and a list of emails, update the user's groups in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the contact management routes work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. The send and receive routes should accept two emails (the sender's email and the receiver's email), a message, update the corresponding users' message lists in the database, and return a success message. The read receipts route should accept two emails (the sender's email and the receiver's email), a message ID, update the corresponding message's read receipt in the database, and return a success message. The encryption route should accept a message, encrypt it, and return the encrypted message. The image sharing route should accept two emails (the sender's email and the receiver's email), an image, update the corresponding users' message lists in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the messaging routes work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding and removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The create group chat route should accept a group name, a list of emails, create a new group chat in the database, and return a success message. The add and remove participants routes should accept a group name, an email, update the corresponding group chat's participants list in the database, and return a success message. The admin roles and permissions route should accept a group name, an email, and a role, update the corresponding group chat's admin roles and permissions in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the group chat routes work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and controlling who can see the status. The post image status route should accept an email, an image, and a visibility duration, update the corresponding user's status in the database, and return a success message. The status visibility control route should accept an email, a list of emails (who can see the status), update the corresponding user's status visibility in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the status/story routes work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend that interacts with the Flask backend. The frontend should have pages for sign up, sign in, profile management, contact management, messaging, group chats, and status/story. Write tests to ensure that the frontend can successfully send requests to the backend and display the responses correctly.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a route for updating online/offline status and a mechanism for queuing messages when the user is offline. The online/offline status route should accept an email and a status (online or offline), update the corresponding user's status in the database, and return a success message. The message queuing mechanism should store messages in a queue when the receiver is offline, and send the messages when the receiver comes online. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive test of the entire application. This includes testing all routes, the frontend, and the offline mode features. Make sure that all tests pass and the application works as expected. If any issues are found, debug and fix them, and then re-run the tests."], "step": "Step 6: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding and removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The create group chat route should accept a group name, a list of emails, create a new group chat in the database, and return a success message. The add and remove participants routes should accept a group name, an email, update the corresponding group chat's participants list in the database, and return a success message. The admin roles and permissions route should accept a group name, an email, and a role, update the corresponding group chat's admin roles and permissions in the database, and return a success message.
