by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. The project will be divided into several modules: `auth`, `profile`, `contacts`, `messaging`, `groups`, `status`, `webapp`, and `connectivity`. Each module will contain the necessary classes and functions to implement the features related to that module. For example, the `auth` module will contain classes and functions for user registration and authentication, while the `messaging` module will contain classes and functions for sending and receiving messages. Also, create a `main.py` file which will serve as the entry point of the application. Finally, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and all necessary files are created.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating a `User` class in the `auth` module, which will represent a user in the system. The `User` class should have methods for signing up, logging in, and recovering a forgotten password. The sign up method should take an email and password as input, and create a new user in the system. The login method should take an email and password as input, and authenticate the user. The password recovery method should take an email as input, and send a password recovery email to the user. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the user registration and authentication features work correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating a `Profile` class in the `profile` module, which will represent a user's profile. The `Profile` class should have methods for setting a profile picture, setting a status message, and configuring privacy settings. The set profile picture method should take an image file as input, and set it as the user's profile picture. The set status message method should take a string as input, and set it as the user's status message. The configure privacy settings method should take a privacy setting as input, and apply it to the user's profile. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the user profile features work correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating a `Contact` class in the `contacts` module, which will represent a contact in the system. The `Contact` class should have methods for blocking and unblocking contacts, and creating, editing, and managing groups. The block contact method should take a contact as input, and block that contact. The unblock contact method should take a contact as input, and unblock that contact. The create group method should take a group name and a list of contacts as input, and create a new group with those contacts. The edit group method should take a group and a list of contacts as input, and update the group with those contacts. The manage groups method should provide an interface for managing groups. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the contact management features work correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating a `Message` class in the `messaging` module, which will represent a message in the system. The `Message` class should have methods for sending and receiving messages, displaying read receipts, encrypting and decrypting messages, and sharing images. The send message method should take a message and a recipient as input, and send the message to the recipient. The receive message method should take a message and a sender as input, and receive the message from the sender. The display read receipt method should display a read receipt when a message is read. The encrypt message method should take a message as input, and return the encrypted message. The decrypt message method should take an encrypted message as input, and return the decrypted message. The share image method should take an image file and a recipient as input, and share the image with the recipient. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the messaging features work correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating a `GroupChat` class in the `groups` module, which will represent a group chat in the system. The `GroupChat` class should have methods for creating a group chat, adding and removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The create group chat method should take a group name, a group picture, and a list of participants as input, and create a new group chat with those participants. The add participant method should take a participant as input, and add that participant to the group chat. The remove participant method should take a participant as input, and remove that participant from the group chat. The manage admin roles method should provide an interface for managing admin roles and permissions. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the group chat features work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating a `Status` class in the `status` module, which will represent a status in the system. The `Status` class should have methods for posting a status, viewing a status, and controlling who can see the status. The post status method should take an image file and a visibility setting as input, and post the status. The view status method should display the status. The control visibility method should take a visibility setting as input, and apply it to the status. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the status/story feature works correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a `WebApp` class in the `webapp` module, which will represent the web application. The `WebApp` class should have methods for displaying the user interface and handling user input. The display user interface method should display the user interface. The handle user input method should take user input as input, and perform the appropriate action. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the web application works correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a `Connectivity` class in the `connectivity` module, which will represent the connectivity of the system. The `Connectivity` class should have methods for checking the connectivity, queuing messages when offline, and displaying the online/offline status. The check connectivity method should check the connectivity of the system. The queue message method should take a message as input, and queue it for sending when the system is back online. The display status method should display the online/offline status. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features work correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, integrate all the modules and features together in the `main.py` file. This includes creating a `GlobalChatService` class, which will represent the global chat service. The `GlobalChatService` class should have methods for starting and stopping the service. The start service method should start the service. The stop service method should stop the service. After integrating all the modules and features together, write tests to ensure that the global chat service works correctly."], "step": "Step 10: Finally, integrate all the modules and features together in the `main.py` file.

You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}], "message_hash": "b51cd92665fd45a921d73520e23ea323caf956e1d8162f2f2a3bded152d9c7d4"}
