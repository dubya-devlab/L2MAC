This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The dictionary should have keys as user IDs and values as another dictionary containing user details like email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and the 'users' dictionary is initialized as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept user details like email and password, generate a unique user ID, and store these details in the 'users' dictionary. The forgotten password recovery route should accept a user ID and send a password recovery email to the associated email address. Since we can't actually send emails, just print a message indicating that the email has been sent. Write tests to ensure that the sign up and password recovery routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept a user ID and the new picture or message, and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly. The privacy settings route should accept a user ID and the new settings, and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly. Write tests to ensure that the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and creating, editing, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept two user IDs and update the 'blocked contacts' list of the first user accordingly. The group routes should accept a user ID and group details, and update the 'groups' list of the user accordingly. Write tests to ensure that the block, unblock, and group routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving text messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. The message routes should accept sender and receiver user IDs, the message, and update a 'messages' dictionary accordingly. The read receipt route should accept a message ID and update the 'messages' dictionary accordingly. The encryption route should accept a message and return the encrypted version of the message. The image sharing route should accept a user ID, an image, and update the 'messages' dictionary accordingly. Write tests to ensure that the message, read receipt, encryption, and image sharing routes work as expected and the 'messages' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding or removing participants, and updating admin roles and permissions. The group chat route should accept a user ID, group chat details, and update the 'groups' list of the user accordingly. The participant routes should accept a group ID, a user ID, and update the 'groups' dictionary accordingly. The admin route should accept a group ID, a user ID, and update the 'groups' dictionary accordingly. Write tests to ensure that the group chat, participant, and admin routes work as expected and the 'groups' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and updating who can see the status. The status route should accept a user ID, an image, and update a 'statuses' dictionary accordingly. The visibility route should accept a status ID, a list of user IDs, and update the 'statuses' dictionary accordingly. Write tests to ensure that the status and visibility routes work as expected and the 'statuses' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a route for accessing the application from a browser. The route should return a simple HTML page with links to all the other routes. Write tests to ensure that the web application route returns the expected HTML page.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a route for updating the online/offline status of a user, and a mechanism for queuing messages when a user is offline. The status route should accept a user ID, a status (online or offline), and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly. The message queuing mechanism should check the status of the receiver before updating the 'messages' dictionary, and if the receiver is offline, add the message to a 'message queue' dictionary instead. Write tests to ensure that the status route and message queuing mechanism work as expected and the 'users', 'messages', and 'message queue' dictionaries are updated correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, review all the code and tests to ensure that everything is working as expected. Run all the tests and make sure they all pass. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues. Once all tests pass, the implementation of the Global Chat Service is complete."], "step": "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding or removing participants, and updating admin roles and permissions. The group chat route should accept a user ID, group chat details, and update the 'groups' list of the user accordingly. The participant routes should accept a group ID, a user ID, and update the 'groups' dictionary accordingly. The admin route should accept a group ID, a user ID, and update the 'groups' dictionary accordingly. Write tests to ensure that the group chat, participant, and admin routes work as expected and the 'groups' dictionary is updated correctly.", "meta_messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\nObjective: Write code for a large system design task.\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional.
