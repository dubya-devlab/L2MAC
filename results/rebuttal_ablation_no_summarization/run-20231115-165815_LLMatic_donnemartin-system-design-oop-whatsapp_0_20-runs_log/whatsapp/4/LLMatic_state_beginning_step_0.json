The project will be structured as a Flask application, with a main app.py file serving as the entry point. Create a 'models' directory to hold the data models for User, Message, Group, and Status. Each model will be represented by a Python class in its own file (user.py, message.py, group.py, status.py). Also, create a 'services' directory to hold the service classes for user management, messaging, group management, and status management. Each service will be represented by a Python class in its own file (user_service.py, message_service.py, group_service.py, status_service.py). Finally, create a 'tests' directory to hold the test files for each service. Each test file will start with the prefix 'test_' followed by the name of the service it tests (test_user_service.py, test_message_service.py, test_group_service.py, test_status_service.py). After setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files, write tests to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and that each file is in its correct location.", "Step 2: Implement the User model. The User model should have fields for id, email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, and a list of blocked contacts. The id field will be a unique identifier for each user. The email and password fields will be used for user registration and authentication. The profile picture and status message fields will be used for the user profile. The privacy settings field will determine who can see the user's details or last seen status. The list of blocked contacts will be used for contact management. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that the User model is implemented correctly and that each field behaves as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the Message model. The Message model should have fields for id, sender, receiver, content, read receipt, and encryption. The id field will be a unique identifier for each message. The sender and receiver fields will be references to User objects. The content field will hold the text of the message. The read receipt field will indicate whether the message has been read by the receiver. The encryption field will indicate whether the message is encrypted. After implementing the Message model, write tests to ensure that the Message model is implemented correctly and that each field behaves as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the Group model. The Group model should have fields for id, name, picture, participants, and admin roles. The id field will be a unique identifier for each group. The name and picture fields will be used for the group profile. The participants field will be a list of references to User objects. The admin roles field will be a list of references to User objects who have admin permissions. After implementing the Group model, write tests to ensure that the Group model is implemented correctly and that each field behaves as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the Status model. The Status model should have fields for id, user, image, visibility, and time limit. The id field will be a unique identifier for each status. The user field will be a reference to a User object. The image field will hold the image of the status. The visibility field will determine who can see the status. The time limit field will determine how long the status is visible. After implementing the Status model, write tests to ensure that the Status model is implemented correctly and that each field behaves as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the UserService class. The UserService class should have methods for user registration, authentication, profile management, and contact management. The user registration method should create a new User object and add it to the database. The authentication method should verify a user's email and password. The profile management methods should allow a user to set their profile picture and status message, and to set their privacy settings. The contact management methods should allow a user to block and unblock contacts. After implementing the UserService class, write tests to ensure that the UserService class is implemented correctly and that each method behaves as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the MessageService class. The MessageService class should have methods for sending and receiving messages, setting read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. The sending and receiving methods should create a new Message object and add it to the database. The read receipt method should update the read receipt field of a Message object. The encryption method should encrypt the content of a Message object. The image sharing method should add an image to the content of a Message object. After implementing the MessageService class, write tests to ensure that the MessageService class is implemented correctly and that each method behaves as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the GroupService class. The GroupService class should have methods for creating groups, managing participants, and setting admin roles. The creating groups method should create a new Group object and add it to the database. The managing participants methods should add and remove participants from a Group object. The setting admin roles method should set the admin roles of a Group object. After implementing the GroupService class, write tests to ensure that the GroupService class is implemented correctly and that each method behaves as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the StatusService class. The StatusService class should have methods for posting statuses, setting visibility, and setting time limits. The posting statuses method should create a new Status object and add it to the database. The setting visibility method should set the visibility of a Status object. The setting time limits method should set the time limit of a Status object. After implementing the StatusService class, write tests to ensure that the StatusService class is implemented correctly and that each method behaves as expected.", "Step 10: Implement the main app.py file. The app.py file should create a Flask application and set up the routes for user registration, authentication, profile management, contact management, messaging, group management, and status management. Each route should call the appropriate method from the UserService, MessageService, GroupService, or StatusService class. After implementing the app.py file, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that each route behaves as expected."], "step": "Step 1: Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
