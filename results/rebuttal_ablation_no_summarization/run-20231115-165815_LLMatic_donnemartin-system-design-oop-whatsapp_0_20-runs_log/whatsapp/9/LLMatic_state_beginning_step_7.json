This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. This dictionary should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the application setup is correct and the mock database can store and retrieve data correctly.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept an email and password, and store this information in the mock database. The forgotten password recovery route should accept an email, verify that the email exists in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication routes work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept an email and the new picture or message, and update the corresponding user's information in the database. The privacy settings route should accept an email and the new settings, and update the corresponding user's information in the database. Write tests to ensure that the profile management routes work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept two emails, and update the corresponding user's blocked contacts list in the database. The group management routes should accept an email, a group name, and a list of contacts, and update the corresponding user's groups in the database. Write tests to ensure that the contact management routes work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. The send and receive routes should accept two emails and a message, and update the corresponding users' message lists in the database. The read receipt route should accept two emails and a message, and update the corresponding message's read status in the database. The encryption route should accept a message, encrypt it, and return the encrypted message. The image sharing route should accept two emails and an image, and update the corresponding users' message lists in the database. Write tests to ensure that the messaging routes work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating groups, adding and removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The create group route should accept an email, a group name, and a list of participants, and create a new group in the database. The add and remove participants routes should accept a group name and a participant email, and update the corresponding group's participant list in the database. The admin roles and permissions route should accept a group name, an admin email, and a list of permissions, and update the corresponding group's admin roles in the database. Write tests to ensure that the group chat routes work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting statuses, and managing who can see the status. The post status route should accept an email, a status, and a visibility list, and update the corresponding user's status in the database. The visibility management route should accept an email, a status, and a new visibility list, and update the corresponding status's visibility in the database. Write tests to ensure that the status/story routes work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a basic HTML template for the chat application, and setting up routes to serve this template. The template should include areas for displaying messages, entering new messages, and managing contacts and groups. Write tests to ensure that the web application routes work as expected and the template is served correctly.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a route for updating online/offline status, and setting up a message queue for when the user is offline. The online/offline status route should accept an email and a status, and update the corresponding user's online status in the database. The message queue should store messages that are sent while the user is offline, and send them when the user comes online. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, run all tests to ensure that all features of the application work as expected. If any tests fail, debug the corresponding feature and rerun the tests until all tests pass. Once all tests pass, the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "Step 8: Implement the web application.
