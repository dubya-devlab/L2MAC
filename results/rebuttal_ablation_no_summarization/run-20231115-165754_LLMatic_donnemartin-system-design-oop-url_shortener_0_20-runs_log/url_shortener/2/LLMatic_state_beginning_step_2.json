Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Flask application and set up the basic structure with the necessary files and folders. The main files will include `app.py` for the application entry point, `models.py` for the data models, `views.py` for the routes and views, and `utils.py` for utility functions. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary dependencies. Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the data models in `models.py`. We will need a User model to represent the users, a URL model to represent the shortened URLs, and a Click model to represent the clicks on the shortened URLs. The User model will have fields for username and password. The URL model will have fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who created it, and an optional expiration date. The Click model will have fields for the URL it relates to, the date/time of the click, and the geographical location of the clicker. Write tests to ensure that the models are defined correctly and can be used to create and retrieve data.", "3. Implement the URL shortening functionality in `utils.py`. This will involve a function to validate a URL, a function to generate a unique shortened URL, and a function to handle custom short link requests. The URL validation function should check that the URL is active and legitimate. The shortened URL generation function should create a unique short link for each URL. The custom short link function should check if a requested short link is available and return it if it is, or an error if it's not. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening functions work correctly.", "4. Implement the user account functionality. This will involve creating routes and views in `views.py` for user registration, login, and viewing their own URLs. The registration view should create a new User in the database. The login view should authenticate a user and start a session. The user URLs view should retrieve all URLs created by the logged-in user. Write tests to ensure that the user account functionality works correctly.", "5. Implement the URL redirection functionality. This will involve creating a route and view in `views.py` for accessing a shortened URL. The view should retrieve the original URL from the database using the shortened URL, record a new Click in the database, and then redirect to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the URL redirection works correctly.", "6. Implement the analytics functionality. This will involve creating routes and views in `views.py` for viewing the statistics of a URL. The statistics should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of each clicker. Write tests to ensure that the analytics functionality works correctly.", "7. Implement the admin dashboard functionality. This will involve creating routes and views in `views.py` for an admin to view all URLs and user accounts, and to delete any URL or user account. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functionality works correctly.", "8. Implement the URL expiration functionality. This will involve adding a field to the URL model for the expiration date/time, and checking this field in the URL redirection view. If the current date/time is after the expiration date/time, the view should return an error instead of redirecting. Write tests to ensure that the URL expiration functionality works correctly.", "9. Once all the functionality is implemented and tested, integrate everything in the `app.py` file. This will involve setting up the Flask application, importing the views, and running the application. Write a test to ensure that the application runs correctly with all the integrated parts.", "10. Finally, review the entire project to ensure that all requirements have been met and that all tests pass. Make any necessary adjustments and run all tests again to confirm. If all tests pass and all requirements are met, the project is complete."], "step": "3. Implement the URL shortening functionality in `utils.py`.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
