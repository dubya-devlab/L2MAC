Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Flask application and set up the basic structure with the necessary files and folders. This includes the main application file (app.py), a folder for templates, a folder for static files, and a folder for tests. Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies for the project. Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a new route in the Flask application that accepts a POST request with a URL to be shortened. The route should validate the URL, generate a unique shortened URL, and return it to the user. The shortened URLs should be stored in an in-memory dictionary for now. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature works correctly, including tests for invalid URLs and duplicate URLs.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. Create another route in the Flask application that accepts a GET request with a shortened URL. The route should look up the original URL from the in-memory dictionary and redirect the user to it. If the shortened URL is not found, the route should return a 404 error. Write tests to ensure that the redirection feature works correctly, including tests for non-existent shortened URLs.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. Each time a shortened URL is accessed, the system should record the date/time of the access and the geographical location of the user. This data should be stored in the in-memory dictionary along with the original URL. Create a new route that accepts a GET request with a shortened URL and returns the analytics data for that URL. Write tests to ensure that the analytics feature works correctly, including tests for non-existent shortened URLs.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Users should be able to create an account with a username and password. The account data should be stored in the in-memory dictionary. Create routes for user registration and login. After logging in, users should be able to view, edit, and delete their shortened URLs. Write tests to ensure that the user accounts feature works correctly, including tests for duplicate usernames and incorrect passwords.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Administrators should be able to view all shortened URLs and user accounts. They should also be able to delete any URL or user account. Create a new route for the admin dashboard that is only accessible to administrators. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature works correctly, including tests for unauthorized access.", "7. Implement the URL expiration feature. Users should be able to set an expiration date/time for their shortened URLs. After the expiration date/time, the shortened URL should no longer redirect to the original URL. Modify the redirection route to check the expiration date/time before redirecting. Write tests to ensure that the URL expiration feature works correctly, including tests for expired URLs.", "8. Refactor the in-memory dictionary to a more suitable data structure. The current in-memory dictionary is not suitable for a large number of URLs and user accounts. Consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table or a trie. Write tests to ensure that the new data structure works correctly and improves the performance of the system.", "9. Implement a caching mechanism to improve the performance of the system. Frequently accessed URLs should be stored in a cache to reduce the number of lookups in the data structure. Consider using a least recently used (LRU) cache for this purpose. Write tests to ensure that the caching mechanism works correctly and improves the performance of the system.", "10. Finally, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire system. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests. Ensure that all features work correctly and that the system can handle a large number of URLs and user accounts. Also, check the system's performance under heavy load and optimize as necessary."], "step": "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature.
