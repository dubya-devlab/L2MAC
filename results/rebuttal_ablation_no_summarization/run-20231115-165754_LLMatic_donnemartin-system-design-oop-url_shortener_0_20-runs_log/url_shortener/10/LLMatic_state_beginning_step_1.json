Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Flask application and set up the basic structure with the necessary files and folders. This includes the main application file (app.py), a folder for templates, a folder for static files, and a folder for tests. Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies for the project. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. This involves creating a form where users can input a URL to be shortened. The form should validate that the input is a valid URL. If the URL is valid, the system should generate a unique shortened URL. If the user chooses a custom short link, the system should check if the link is available. If it is, the system should use the custom link as the shortened URL. If it's not, the system should inform the user that the link is not available. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature works as expected.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. When a user accesses a shortened URL, the system should redirect them to the original URL. This involves mapping each shortened URL to its corresponding original URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the redirection feature works as expected.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. The system should keep track of each click on a shortened URL. This includes the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the analytics feature works as expected.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Users should be able to create accounts. Account holders should be able to view all their shortened URLs, edit or delete their shortened URLs, and view analytics for all their shortened URLs. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the user accounts feature works as expected.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Administrators should be able to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature works as expected.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. Users should be able to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. After the expiration date/time, the shortened URL should no longer redirect to the original URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the expiration feature works as expected.", "8. After implementing all the features, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire system. This involves running all the tests written in the previous steps. If any test fails, debug the corresponding feature and fix the issue. After fixing the issue, rerun the tests to ensure that all tests pass.", "9. After all tests pass, perform a code review to ensure that the code follows best practices. This includes checking for code readability, maintainability, and efficiency. If any issues are found during the code review, refactor the code to fix the issues.", "10. Finally, prepare the project for deployment. This involves setting up the necessary configuration for deployment, such as setting up the production database and configuring the server. After setting up the deployment configuration, deploy the application to a production server.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
