Start by setting up the project structure. Create a Flask application with the necessary routes for the URL shortening service. The routes should include '/shorten' for shortening URLs, '/' for redirecting shortened URLs to their original URLs, '/analytics' for viewing URL analytics, '/account' for user account related operations, and '/admin' for admin dashboard. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store the data. The data to be stored includes user accounts, shortened URLs, and analytics data. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and the routes are working as expected.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. This involves creating a function that takes a URL as input, validates it, and then generates a unique shortened URL. The validation should check if the URL is active and legitimate. The shortened URL can be generated by creating a hash of the original URL. If a user chooses a custom short link, check if it's available and use it as the shortened URL. Store the original URL and its corresponding shortened URL in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature is working correctly.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. This involves creating a function that takes a shortened URL as input and redirects to the original URL. The function should look up the original URL from the mock database using the shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection feature is working correctly.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. This involves creating a function that takes a shortened URL as input and returns statistics about the URL. The statistics should include the number of clicks, date/time of each click, and geographical location of the clicker. The function should retrieve this data from the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the analytics feature is working correctly.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. This involves creating functions for creating accounts, viewing all shortened URLs of a user, editing or deleting shortened URLs, and viewing analytics for all shortened URLs. The functions should interact with the mock database to perform these operations. Write tests to ensure that the user accounts feature is working correctly.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. This involves creating functions for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. The functions should interact with the mock database to perform these operations. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature is working correctly.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. This involves creating a function that allows users to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. The function should store the expiration date/time in the mock database and check it before redirecting a shortened URL. If the current date/time is past the expiration date/time, the function should return an error instead of redirecting. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature is working correctly.", "8. After implementing all the features, integrate them into the Flask application. The '/shorten' route should use the URL shortening feature, the '/' route should use the redirection and expiration features, the '/analytics' route should use the analytics feature, the '/account' route should use the user accounts feature, and the '/admin' route should use the admin dashboard feature. Write tests to ensure that the integration is working correctly.", "9. Perform a final round of testing to ensure that all features are working together as expected. This includes testing the URL shortening, redirection, analytics, user accounts, admin dashboard, and expiration features. Also, test the Flask application to ensure that it's handling requests and responses correctly.", "10. Finally, create a requirements.txt file that lists all the Python packages used in the project. This includes Flask for the web application, pytest for testing, and any other packages used. Also, write a README.md file that explains how to set up and run the project, and describes the functionality of the URL shortening service."], "step": "3. Implement the redirection feature.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
