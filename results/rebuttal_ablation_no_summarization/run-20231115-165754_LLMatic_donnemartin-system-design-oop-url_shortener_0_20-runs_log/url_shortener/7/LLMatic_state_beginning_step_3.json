Create a Flask application in a file named 'app.py'. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and requests (for URL validation). Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a 'url_shortener.py' file that will contain the logic for URL shortening. This will include a function to validate the URL, a function to generate a unique shortened URL, and a function to handle custom short links. The URL validation function will send a GET request to the URL and check the response status. The unique shortened URL generation function will use a simple hashing algorithm. The custom short link function will check if the requested short link is already in use. Write tests for each of these functions to ensure they work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In the 'app.py' file, add a route that will handle the redirection. This route will take the shortened URL as a parameter, look up the original URL in the database, and redirect to it. Write a test to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Create a 'analytics.py' file that will contain the logic for tracking and displaying analytics. This will include functions to track the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. The geographical location can be determined using the IP address of the clicker. Write tests for each of these functions to ensure they work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a 'user_accounts.py' file that will contain the logic for user account management. This will include functions to create an account, view all shortened URLs associated with an account, edit or delete a shortened URL, and view analytics for all shortened URLs. Write tests for each of these functions to ensure they work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an 'admin_dashboard.py' file that will contain the logic for the admin dashboard. This will include functions to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests for each of these functions to ensure they work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the expiration feature. Add a function in the 'url_shortener.py' file to set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. This function will add an expiration date/time to the URL record in the database. In the redirection route in the 'app.py' file, add a check for the expiration date/time before redirecting. If the current date/time is past the expiration date/time, the redirection should not occur. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature works correctly.", "Step 8: Integrate all the features in the 'app.py' file. This will involve adding routes for each feature and calling the appropriate functions from the 'url_shortener.py', 'analytics.py', 'user_accounts.py', and 'admin_dashboard.py' files. Write tests to ensure that all routes work correctly and all features are integrated properly.", "Step 9: Finalize the project by ensuring that all tests pass and the application runs without errors. Run pytest to execute all the tests and check the results. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues. Once all tests pass, run the application and manually test all the features to ensure they work as expected.", "Step 10: Document the project. Write comments in the code explaining complex bits of logic. Also, create a README file explaining how to set up and run the project, and describing each feature and how it works. Finally, package the project for distribution. This will involve creating a setup.py file and possibly other files depending on the distribution method chosen."], "step": "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
