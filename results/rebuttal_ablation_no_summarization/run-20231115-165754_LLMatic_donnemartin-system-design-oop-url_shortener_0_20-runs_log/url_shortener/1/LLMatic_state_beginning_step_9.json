Create a Flask application with the necessary routes for the URL shortening service. The routes should include '/shorten' for shortening URLs, '/' for redirecting shortened URLs to their original URLs, '/analytics' for viewing URL analytics, '/account' for user account related operations, and '/admin' for admin dashboard. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store the data. The data to be stored includes user accounts, shortened URLs, and analytics data. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the routes are working as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Users should be able to input a URL to be shortened. The system should validate that the URL is active and legitimate. If the URL is valid, the system should generate a unique shortened URL. Users should also have the option to choose custom short links, subject to availability. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature is working correctly. The tests should cover all possible scenarios, including valid and invalid URLs, and custom and non-custom short links.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. Accessing the shortened URL should redirect to the original URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the redirection feature is working correctly. The tests should cover all possible scenarios, including valid and invalid shortened URLs.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Users should be able to view statistics about their shortened URLs. The statistics should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the analytics feature is working correctly. The tests should cover all possible scenarios, including valid and invalid shortened URLs, and different types of analytics data.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Users should be able to create accounts. Account holders should be able to view all their shortened URLs, edit or delete their shortened URLs, and view analytics for all their shortened URLs. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the user accounts feature is working correctly. The tests should cover all possible scenarios, including account creation, viewing, editing, and deleting shortened URLs, and viewing analytics.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Administrators should be able to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature is working correctly. The tests should cover all possible scenarios, including viewing all shortened URLs, deleting URLs and user accounts, and monitoring system performance and analytics.", "Step 7: Implement the expiration feature. Users should be able to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. After the expiration date/time, the shortened URL should no longer redirect to the original URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the expiration feature is working correctly. The tests should cover all possible scenarios, including setting an expiration date/time, accessing the shortened URL before and after the expiration date/time, and ensuring that the shortened URL no longer redirects after the expiration date/time.", "Step 8: After implementing all the features, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire system. The tests should cover all the features and all possible scenarios. The tests should ensure that all the features are working correctly and that the system is robust and reliable.", "Step 9: After testing the system, perform a code review to ensure that the code is clean, efficient, and follows best practices. The code review should also ensure that the code is well-documented and easy to understand.", "Step 10: Finally, package the project for deployment.
