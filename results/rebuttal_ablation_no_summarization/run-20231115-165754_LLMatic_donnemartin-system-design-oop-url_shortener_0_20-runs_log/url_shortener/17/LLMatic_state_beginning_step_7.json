"steps": ["Step 1: Start by setting up the project structure. Create a Flask application with the necessary routes for the URL shortening service. The routes should include '/shorten' for shortening URLs, '/' for redirecting shortened URLs to their original URLs, '/analytics' for viewing URL analytics, '/account' for user account related operations, and '/admin' for admin dashboard. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file with all the necessary dependencies such as Flask, pytest, and any other necessary libraries. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and all routes are accessible.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a function that takes a URL as input, validates it, and returns a shortened version of the URL. The function should generate a unique identifier for each URL and store the mapping between the original URL and the shortened URL in an in-memory dictionary. If a custom short link is provided, the function should check its availability and use it if possible. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening function works correctly and handles invalid URLs and custom short links properly.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. Modify the route handler for '/' to redirect to the original URL when a shortened URL is accessed. The handler should look up the original URL from the in-memory dictionary using the unique identifier in the shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly and handles non-existent shortened URLs properly.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Create a function that records each access to a shortened URL along with the date/time and geographical location of the clicker. The function should update the in-memory dictionary with this information. Modify the '/analytics' route handler to return the analytics for a given shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that the analytics function works correctly and the '/analytics' route returns the correct data.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a class for user accounts with attributes for the user's shortened URLs and their analytics. Modify the URL shortening and analytics functions to associate the shortened URLs and their analytics with the user's account. Modify the '/account' route handler to allow users to view, edit, and delete their shortened URLs and view their analytics. Write tests to ensure that the user accounts feature works correctly and the '/account' route handles user operations properly.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create a class for admin accounts with attributes for all shortened URLs and their analytics. Modify the '/admin' route handler to allow administrators to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature works correctly and the '/admin' route handles admin operations properly.", "Step 7: Implement the URL expiration feature. Modify the URL shortening function to accept an optional expiration date/time for the shortened URL and store it in the in-memory dictionary. Modify the redirection function to check the expiration date/time before redirecting to the original URL. If the shortened URL has expired, the function should return an error message instead of redirecting. Write tests to ensure that the URL expiration feature works correctly and expired URLs are handled properly.", "Step 8: Implement error handling for the entire application. Create custom error handlers for common HTTP errors such as 404 and 500. The error handlers should return appropriate error messages and HTTP status codes. Write tests to ensure that the error handlers work correctly and return the correct responses.", "Step 9: Implement logging for the application. Create a logger that records important events such as URL shortening, redirection, account creation, and admin operations. The logger should write to a file and also print to the console. Write tests to ensure that the logger works correctly and records the correct events.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application. Run all the tests created in the previous steps and ensure that they all pass. Also, perform manual testing by running the application and interacting with it through a web browser. Check that all features work as expected and all routes return the correct responses. If any issues are found, debug and fix them, and then re-run the tests until they all pass."], "step": "Step 8: Implement error handling for the entire application.
