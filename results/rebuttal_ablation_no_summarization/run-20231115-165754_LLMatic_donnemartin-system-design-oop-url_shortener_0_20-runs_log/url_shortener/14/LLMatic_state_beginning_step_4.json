Create a Flask application with the necessary routes for the URL shortening service. The routes should include a home page for URL submission, a redirection route for shortened URLs, a user registration and login page, an admin dashboard, and a user dashboard for viewing and managing shortened URLs. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user information, shortened URLs, and their corresponding original URLs. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the routes return the expected responses.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. This involves creating a function that takes a URL as input, validates it, and then generates a unique shortened URL. The function should also handle the case where a user wants to use a custom short link. The shortened URL should be stored in the mock database along with the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening function works as expected, correctly validates URLs, and generates unique shortened URLs.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. This involves creating a function that takes a shortened URL as input, retrieves the corresponding original URL from the mock database, and then redirects to that URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection function works as expected and correctly redirects to the original URL.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. This involves creating a function that records information about each click on a shortened URL, such as the date/time of the click and the geographical location of the clicker. This information should be stored in the mock database. Also, create a function that retrieves and displays this information for a given shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that the analytics functions work as expected and correctly record and display click information.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. This involves creating functions for user registration and login, as well as functions for viewing, editing, and deleting shortened URLs associated with a user account. User information and associated URLs should be stored in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the user account functions work as expected and correctly manage user information and associated URLs.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. This involves creating functions for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functions work as expected and correctly manage URLs and user accounts.", "Step 7: Implement the expiration feature. This involves creating a function that allows users to set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. The function should check the current date/time against the expiration date/time and disable the shortened URL if it has expired. Write tests to ensure that the expiration function works as expected and correctly disables expired URLs.", "Step 8: Integrate all the features into the Flask application. The home page should allow users to submit URLs for shortening, the redirection route should redirect to the original URL of a shortened URL, the user registration and login page should manage user accounts, the admin dashboard should provide administrative functions, and the user dashboard should allow users to manage their shortened URLs. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application works as a cohesive whole and correctly integrates all the features.", "Step 9: Perform a final round of testing on the entire application. This should include unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for the interaction between different parts of the application, and end-to-end tests for the entire user flow. Make sure that all tests pass and that the application meets all the functional requirements.", "Step 10: After all tests pass, finalize the code and prepare it for deployment. This includes cleaning up the code, adding necessary comments and documentation, and ensuring that the code follows best practices for Python and Flask applications.
