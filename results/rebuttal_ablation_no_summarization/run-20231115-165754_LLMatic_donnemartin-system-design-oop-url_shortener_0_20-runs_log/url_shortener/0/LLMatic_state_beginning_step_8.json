Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Flask application and set up the basic structure with the necessary files and folders. This includes the main application file (app.py), a folder for templates, a folder for static files, and a folder for tests. Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies for the project. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a new route in the Flask application that accepts a POST request with a URL to be shortened. The route should validate the URL, generate a unique shortened URL, and return it in the response. Use a Python library like pyshorteners to generate the shortened URL. After implementing this feature, write a test to ensure that the route correctly shortens valid URLs and returns an error for invalid URLs.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. Create another route in the Flask application that accepts a GET request with a shortened URL. The route should redirect the user to the original URL associated with the shortened URL. After implementing this feature, write a test to ensure that the route correctly redirects to the original URL for valid shortened URLs and returns an error for invalid shortened URLs.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. Each time a shortened URL is accessed, the system should record the date/time of the access and the geographical location of the user. Use a Python library like geoip2 to determine the geographical location based on the user's IP address. After implementing this feature, write a test to ensure that the system correctly records the necessary analytics data each time a shortened URL is accessed.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Create routes for user registration and login. Users should be able to register with a username and password, and then login with those credentials. Use a Python library like Flask-Login to handle user authentication. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that users can register, login, and are correctly authenticated.", "6. Implement the feature for account holders to view, edit, and delete their shortened URLs. Create routes for these actions, and ensure that only the owner of a shortened URL can perform these actions. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that account holders can view, edit, and delete their shortened URLs, and that other users cannot perform these actions.", "7. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create routes for administrators to view all shortened URLs and user accounts, and to delete any URL or user account. Ensure that only administrators can access these routes. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that administrators can perform these actions and that other users cannot.", "8. Implement the URL expiration feature. When a user creates a shortened URL, they should be able to set an expiration date/time. After this date/time, the shortened URL should no longer redirect to the original URL. After implementing this feature, write a test to ensure that shortened URLs expire correctly.", "9. Implement the feature for users to choose custom short links. When a user creates a shortened URL, they should have the option to specify a custom short link. The system should check if the custom short link is available, and if so, use it instead of generating a random one. After implementing this feature, write a test to ensure that users can choose custom short links and that the system correctly checks for availability.", "10.
