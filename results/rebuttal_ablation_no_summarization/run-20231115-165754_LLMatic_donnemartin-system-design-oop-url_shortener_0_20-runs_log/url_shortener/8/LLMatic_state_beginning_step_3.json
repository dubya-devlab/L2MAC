Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Flask application and set up the basic structure with the necessary files and folders. This includes the main application file (app.py), a folder for templates, a folder for static files, and a folder for tests. Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies for the project. Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a new route in the Flask application that accepts a POST request with a URL to be shortened. The route should validate the URL, generate a unique shortened URL, and return it to the user. If the user provides a custom short link, the system should check for its availability and use it if possible. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature works correctly, including tests for invalid URLs, duplicate custom short links, and successful URL shortening.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. Create another route in the Flask application that accepts a GET request with a shortened URL. The route should redirect the user to the original URL associated with the shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection feature works correctly, including tests for invalid shortened URLs and successful redirection.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. Each time a shortened URL is accessed, the system should record the date/time of the click and the geographical location of the clicker. The system should also provide a way for users to view these statistics. Write tests to ensure that the analytics feature works correctly, including tests for recording and retrieving click data.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Users should be able to create accounts, view all their shortened URLs, edit or delete their shortened URLs, and view analytics for all their shortened URLs. Write tests to ensure that the user accounts feature works correctly, including tests for account creation, URL management, and analytics viewing.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Administrators should be able to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature works correctly, including tests for URL and account management, and system monitoring.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. Users should be able to set an expiration date/time for their shortened URLs. After the expiration date/time, the shortened URL should no longer redirect to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature works correctly, including tests for setting and enforcing expiration dates/times.", "8. Once all features have been implemented and tested individually, write integration tests to ensure that they work correctly together. These tests should cover typical user workflows, such as creating an account, shortening a URL, accessing the shortened URL, viewing analytics, and managing URLs.", "9. After all tests have passed, perform a code review to ensure that the code follows best practices for Python and Flask development. This includes checking for consistent code style, proper error handling, efficient use of resources, and clear, concise comments.", "10. Finally, prepare the application for deployment. This includes setting up a production-ready server, configuring the application for the production environment, and creating a deployment script. Write a test to ensure that the application can be deployed successfully and runs correctly in the production environment."], "step": "4. Implement the analytics feature.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
