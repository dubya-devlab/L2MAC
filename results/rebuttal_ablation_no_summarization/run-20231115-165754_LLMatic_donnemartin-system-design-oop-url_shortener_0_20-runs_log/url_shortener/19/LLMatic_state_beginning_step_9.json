Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and requests (for URL validation). Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain a function to generate a unique shortened URL. The function should take a URL as input and return a unique shortened URL. The shortened URL can be generated by hashing the original URL and taking a substring of the hash. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly generates unique shortened URLs.", "Step 3: Implement the URL validation feature. In the `url_shortener.py` file, add a function to validate that a URL is active and legitimate. The function should send a GET request to the URL and check the response status. If the status is 200, the URL is valid. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly validates URLs.", "Step 4: Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that takes a shortened URL as a parameter. When the route is accessed, it should redirect to the original URL associated with the shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain functions to track and retrieve analytics data. The data should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. The geographical location can be determined from the IP address of the clicker. Write tests to ensure that the analytics functions work correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain functions to handle user account operations such as creating an account, viewing all shortened URLs associated with an account, and editing or deleting shortened URLs. Write tests to ensure that the user account functions work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In the `app.py` file, add routes for the admin dashboard. The dashboard should allow administrators to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functions work correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration feature. In the `url_shortener.py` file, add a function to set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. When the expiration date/time passes, the shortened URL should no longer redirect to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the URL expiration feature works correctly.", "Step 9: Integrate all the features. In the `app.py` file, add routes for the URL shortening, analytics, user accounts, and URL expiration features. The routes should call the appropriate functions from the `url_shortener.py`, `analytics.py`, and `user_accounts.py` files. Write tests to ensure that all the features work together correctly.", "Step 10: Finalize the project. Review all the code to ensure that it follows best practices.
