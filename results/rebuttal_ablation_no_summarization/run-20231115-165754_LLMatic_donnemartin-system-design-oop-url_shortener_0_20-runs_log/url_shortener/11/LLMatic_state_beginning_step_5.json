up the project structure. Create a Flask application with the necessary routes for the URL shortening service. The routes should include '/shorten' for shortening URLs, '/' for redirecting shortened URLs to their original URLs, '/analytics' for viewing URL analytics, '/account' for user account related operations, and '/admin' for admin dashboard. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store the data. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and the routes are working as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a function that takes a URL as input, validates it, and generates a unique shortened URL. The validation should check if the URL is active and legitimate. The shortened URL should be a random string of characters. If the user chooses a custom short link, check if it's available and use it as the shortened URL. Store the original URL and the shortened URL in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature is working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. When a user accesses a shortened URL, the system should redirect them to the original URL. Create a function that takes a shortened URL as input, retrieves the original URL from the database, and redirects the user to it. Write tests to ensure that the redirection feature is working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Each time a shortened URL is clicked, the system should record the click. The recorded data should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. Create a function that retrieves this data from the database and displays it to the user. Write tests to ensure that the analytics feature is working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Users should be able to create accounts, view all their shortened URLs, edit or delete their shortened URLs, and view analytics for all their shortened URLs. Create functions for user registration, login, viewing URLs, editing URLs, deleting URLs, and viewing URL analytics. Store user data and their associated URLs in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the user accounts feature is working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Administrators should be able to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Create functions for viewing all URLs, deleting URLs, deleting user accounts, and viewing system analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature is working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the URL expiration feature. Users should be able to set an expiration date/time for their shortened URLs. After the expiration date/time, the shortened URL should no longer redirect to the original URL. Create a function that checks the expiration date/time of a URL before redirecting. Write tests to ensure that the URL expiration feature is working correctly.", "Step 8: Integrate all the features into the Flask application. The '/shorten' route should use the URL shortening function, the '/' route should use the redirection function, the '/analytics' route should use the analytics function, the '/account' route should use the user accounts functions, and the '/admin' route should use the admin dashboard functions. Write tests to ensure that all the features are integrated correctly and the application is working as expected.", "Step 9: Perform a final round of testing. Run all the tests created in the previous steps to ensure that all the features are working correctly and the application is ready for deployment. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues.", "Step 10: Prepare the application for deployment. Create a requirements.txt file with all the necessary Python packages. Also, write a README file with instructions on how to run the application and the tests. Finally, package the application for deployment."], "step": "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature.
