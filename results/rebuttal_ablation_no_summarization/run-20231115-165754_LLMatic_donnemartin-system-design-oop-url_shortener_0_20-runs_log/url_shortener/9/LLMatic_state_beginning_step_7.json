"steps": ["Step 1: Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Flask application and set up the basic structure with the necessary files and folders. The main files will include 'app.py' for the application entry point, 'requirements.txt' for the project dependencies, and 'config.py' for the application configuration. Also, create a 'services' folder to hold the service classes and a 'models' folder to hold the data models. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a new service class 'UrlShortener' in the 'services' folder. This class will have methods for validating URLs, generating unique shortened URLs, and allowing users to choose custom short links. The 'UrlShortener' class will use an in-memory dictionary to store the original and shortened URLs. After implementing the URL shortening feature, write tests to ensure that the URL validation, shortening, and custom link features work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In the 'app.py' file, add a new route that takes a shortened URL and redirects to the original URL. This route will use the 'UrlShortener' service to look up the original URL. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that accessing a shortened URL correctly redirects to the original URL.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Create a new service class 'Analytics' in the 'services' folder. This class will have methods for recording and retrieving statistics about shortened URLs, such as the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. The 'Analytics' class will use an in-memory dictionary to store the analytics data. After implementing the analytics feature, write tests to ensure that the analytics data is correctly recorded and retrieved.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a new service class 'UserAccounts' in the 'services' folder. This class will have methods for creating accounts, viewing all shortened URLs of an account, and editing or deleting shortened URLs. The 'UserAccounts' class will use an in-memory dictionary to store the user account data. After implementing the user accounts feature, write tests to ensure that user accounts can be created and managed correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In the 'app.py' file, add new routes for administrators to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. These routes will use the 'UrlShortener', 'Analytics', and 'UserAccounts' services. After implementing the admin dashboard feature, write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard works as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the URL expiration feature. Add a new method in the 'UrlShortener' service to set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. Modify the redirection route in the 'app.py' file to check the expiration date/time before redirecting to the original URL. After implementing the URL expiration feature, write tests to ensure that URLs expire correctly.", "Step 8: Integrate the services. In the 'app.py' file, use the 'UrlShortener', 'Analytics', and 'UserAccounts' services to implement the full functionality of the URL shortening service. After integrating the services, write tests to ensure that the entire application works as expected.", "Step 9: Finalize the application. Review the code to ensure that it follows best practices for Python and Flask. Check that all features are implemented correctly and that all tests pass. If necessary, refactor the code to improve its quality and maintainability.", "Step 10: Document the application. Write comments to explain complex bits of logic.
