Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Flask application and set up the basic structure with the necessary files and folders.

Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies for the project. Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a new route in the Flask application that accepts a POST request with a URL to be shortened. The route should validate the URL, generate a unique shortened URL, and return it to the user. If the user provides a custom short link, the system should check for its availability and use it if possible. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature works correctly, including tests for invalid URLs, duplicate custom short links, and successful URL shortening.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. Create another route in the Flask application that accepts a GET request with a shortened URL. The route should redirect the user to the original URL associated with the shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection feature works correctly, including tests for invalid shortened URLs and successful redirection.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. Each time a shortened URL is accessed, the system should record the date/time of the click and the geographical location of the clicker. The system should also provide a way for users to view these statistics. Write tests to ensure that the analytics feature works correctly, including tests for recording clicks and retrieving statistics.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Users should be able to create accounts, view all their shortened URLs, edit or delete their shortened URLs, and view analytics for all their shortened URLs. Write tests to ensure that the user accounts feature works correctly, including tests for account creation, URL management, and analytics viewing.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Administrators should be able to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature works correctly, including tests for URL viewing, account and URL deletion, and system monitoring.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. Users should be able to set an expiration date/time for their shortened URLs. After the expiration date/time, the shortened URL should no longer redirect to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature works correctly, including tests for setting expiration dates/times and expired URL handling.", "8. Once all the features have been implemented and tested individually, integrate them together and test the entire system as a whole. This includes testing the interaction between different features and the overall user experience.", "9. After the system has been thoroughly tested, optimize the code for performance and readability. This includes refactoring any complex or inefficient code, adding comments to explain the code, and ensuring that the code follows best practices for Python and Flask.", "10.

No placeholders.\nOnly use the functions you have been provided with.\nOnly use the `write_files` to output code.\n\nYou must act autonomously and you will receive no human input at any stage. You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}], "message_hash": "9d437aca9075da6d019db478a82f0712d45a7c5555d72f2731d3eb6fc9636f5c"}
