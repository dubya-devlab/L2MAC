Create a Flask application with the necessary routes for the URL shortening service. The routes should include '/shorten' for shortening URLs, '/' for redirecting shortened URLs to their original URLs, '/analytics' for viewing URL analytics, '/account' for user account related operations, and '/admin' for admin dashboard. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file with all the necessary dependencies such as Flask, pytest, and any other necessary libraries. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and all routes are accessible.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a function that takes a URL as input, validates it, and returns a shortened version of the URL. The function should generate a unique identifier for each URL and store the mapping between the original URL and the shortened URL in an in-memory dictionary. If a custom short link is provided, the function should check its availability and use it if it's not already taken. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening function works correctly and handles invalid URLs and duplicate custom short links appropriately.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. Modify the route handler for '/' to redirect to the original URL when a shortened URL is accessed. The handler should look up the original URL from the in-memory dictionary using the unique identifier in the shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly and handles non-existent shortened URLs appropriately.", "Step 4: Implement the basic analytics feature. Each time a shortened URL is accessed, the system should record the date/time of the access. The system should provide a function to retrieve the access times for a given shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that the analytics function works correctly and handles non-existent shortened URLs appropriately.", "Step 5: Implement the user account feature. Users should be able to create accounts with a username and password. The system should store the account information in an in-memory dictionary. Account holders should be able to view, edit, and delete their shortened URLs. Write tests to ensure that the account creation and management functions work correctly and handle invalid inputs and duplicate usernames appropriately.", "Step 6: Extend the analytics feature to include more detailed information. In addition to the date/time of access, the system should also record the geographical location of the clicker. The system should provide a function to retrieve the detailed analytics for a given shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that the extended analytics function works correctly and handles non-existent shortened URLs appropriately.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Administrators should be able to view all shortened URLs and user accounts. They should also be able to delete any URL or user account. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functions work correctly and handle non-existent URLs and user accounts appropriately.", "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration feature. Users should be able to set an expiration date/time for their shortened URLs. The system should check the expiration date/time before redirecting a shortened URL and return an error if the URL has expired. Write tests to ensure that the URL expiration function works correctly and handles non-existent and expired URLs appropriately.", "Step 9: Extend the admin dashboard to include system performance and analytics. Administrators should be able to view statistics about the overall usage of the URL shortening service, such as the total number of shortened URLs and the most frequently accessed URLs. Write tests to ensure that the system performance and analytics functions work correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, conduct a comprehensive testing of the entire system. Run all the tests written in the previous steps to ensure that all features of the URL shortening service work correctly together.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
