Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask application with the necessary files and directories. The main files will include 'app.py' for the Flask application, 'models.py' for the data models, 'views.py' for the routes and views, and 'utils.py' for utility functions. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list all the Python packages required for this project. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the data models in 'models.py'. The main data models will include 'User', 'URL', and 'Click'. The 'User' model will have fields such as 'id', 'username', and 'password'. The 'URL' model will have fields such as 'id', 'original_url', 'shortened_url', 'user_id', and 'expiration_date'. The 'Click' model will have fields such as 'id', 'url_id', 'timestamp', and 'location'. After implementing the data models, write tests to ensure that the models are working correctly and can interact with the mock database.", "Step 3: Implement the URL shortening feature. In 'utils.py', write a function to generate a unique shortened URL. This function will take an original URL as input and return a shortened URL. Also, write a function to validate that a given URL is active and legitimate. In 'views.py', create a route where users can input a URL to be shortened. This route will use the functions from 'utils.py' to validate the URL and generate a shortened URL. After implementing the URL shortening feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the redirection feature. In 'views.py', create a route that takes a shortened URL and redirects to the original URL. This route will use the 'URL' model to find the original URL associated with the shortened URL. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the analytics feature. In 'utils.py', write a function to record a click event. This function will create a new 'Click' instance and store the timestamp and location of the click. In 'views.py', create a route where users can view statistics about their shortened URLs. This route will use the 'Click' model to find all click events associated with a given URL and return the statistics. After implementing the analytics feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the user accounts feature. In 'views.py', create routes for user registration, login, and logout. The registration route will create a new 'User' instance. The login route will authenticate a user and start a new session. The logout route will end the current session. Also, create a route where account holders can view all their shortened URLs. This route will use the 'User' and 'URL' models to find all URLs associated with the current user. After implementing the user accounts feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In 'views.py', create a route where administrators can view all shortened URLs and user accounts. This route will use the 'User' and 'URL' models to find all URLs and users. Also, create routes where administrators can delete any URL or user account. These routes will use the 'User' and 'URL' models to delete the specified URL or user. After implementing the admin dashboard feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration feature. In 'utils.py', write a function to check if a URL has expired. This function will compare the current time with the expiration date of the URL. In 'views.py', modify the redirection route to use this function and return an error if the URL has expired. Also, create a route where users can set an expiration date/time for their shortened URLs. This route will update the 'expiration_date' field of the 'URL' model. After implementing the URL expiration feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 9: After implementing all the features, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application. Use pytest to run all the tests written in the previous steps. Ensure that all tests pass and that the application works as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, prepare the application for deployment. Update the 'requirements.txt' file with any additional packages that were used during development. Also, write a 'README.md' file with instructions on how to run and use the application. After preparing for deployment, run a final round of tests to ensure that the application is ready for production."], "step": "Step 9: After implementing all the features, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application.
