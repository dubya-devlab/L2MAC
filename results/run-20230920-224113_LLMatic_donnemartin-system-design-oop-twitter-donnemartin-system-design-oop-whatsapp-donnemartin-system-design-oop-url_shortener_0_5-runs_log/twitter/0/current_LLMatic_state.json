Try to solve the problem in the minimal steps necessary, in no more than 10 steps. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. The last step should be running any tests automatically if they exist, and the penultimate step writing these tests. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test.
