For example, the User class should have methods for following another user, posting a tweet, replying to a tweet, sending a direct message, etc. The Tweet class should have methods for setting privacy controls, getting replies, etc.\",\n    \"Step 2: Create the Model layer for the system. This includes creating the data structures for each class and implementing the methods defined in Step 1. The Model layer should interact with a hypothetical database to store and retrieve data.\",\n    \"Step 3: Create the View layer for the system. This includes creating functions that display the data from the Model layer to the user. For example, a function that displays a user's tweets, a function that displays a conversation, a function that displays trending tweets, etc.\",\n    \"Step 4: Create the Controller layer for the system. This includes creating functions that handle user input and call the appropriate functions from the Model and View layers. For example, a function that handles a user posting a tweet, a function that handles a user replying to a tweet, a function that handles a user following another user, etc.\",\n    \"Step 5: Create the entrypoint file for the system. This file should import the Controller layer and start the application.\",\n    \"Step 6: Write tests for the Model layer. These tests should ensure that the data structures and methods for each class are working correctly.\",\n    \"Step 7: Write tests for the View layer. These tests should ensure that the functions are correctly displaying data from the Model layer.\",\n    \"Step 8: Write tests for the Controller layer. These tests should ensure that the functions are correctly handling user input and calling the appropriate functions from the Model and View layers.\",\n    \"Step 9: Run the tests for the Model, View, and Controller layers. If any tests fail, go back to the appropriate step and fix the issue.\",\n    \"Step 10: Once all tests pass, the system is complete. The final step is to run the application from the entrypoint file and manually test the system to ensure everything is working as expected.\"\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}]}
