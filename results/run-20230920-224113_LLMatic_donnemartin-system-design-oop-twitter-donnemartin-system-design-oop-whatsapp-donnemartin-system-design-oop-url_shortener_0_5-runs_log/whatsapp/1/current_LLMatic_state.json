No placeholders.\n\nYou will start with the \"entrypoint\" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.\n\nFollow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.\nMake sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.\nWhen writing code if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.\nInclude module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.\n\nUseful to know:\n\nAlways use the programming language the user asks for.\nFor Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.\nFor NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.\nAlways add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.\nAdd comments explaining very complex bits of logic.\nAlways follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.\nYou can use any package and any other packages you wish to install.\n\nPython toolbelt preferences:\n- pytest\n- dataclasses\n\nObjective:```\nWrite complete MVC code for the following system design task. Design Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp (A Global Chat Service)\nFeatures to implement: \n1. One-on-one text messaging between users.\n2. Support group chats.\n3. Delivered and read status\n4. Support sending .jpg images between users.\n5. End-to-end message encryption.\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating a detailed step-by-step plan. Try to solve the problem in the minimal steps necessary, in no more than 10 steps. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. The last step should be running any tests automatically if they exist, and the penultimate step writing these tests. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "provide_detailed_sub_task_steps_for_sub_agents", "arguments": "{\n  \"steps\": [\n    \"Step 1: Define the core classes and their methods for the chat service.
