Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. The last step should be running any tests automatically if they exist, and the penultimate step writing these tests. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "provide_detailed_sub_task_steps_for_sub_agents", "arguments": "{\n  \"steps\": [\n    \"1. Create a Python Flask application with the following routes: '/', '/shorten', '/<short_url>', '/stats', '/delete_expired. The '/' route will serve a simple form to input a URL to shorten. The '/shorten' route will accept POST requests with a URL to shorten and an optional custom alias, and return the shortened URL. The '/<short_url>' route will redirect to the original URL associated with the short URL. The '/stats' route will return the click stats for a given short URL. The '/delete_expired' route will delete all expired URLs from the database.\",\n    \"2. Create a URL model with the following fields: original_url, short_url, creation_date, expiration_date, click_count. The original_url field will store the original URL. The short_url field will store the shortened URL or alias. The creation_date field will store the date and time when the URL was shortened. The expiration_date field will store the date and time when the URL will expire. The click_count field will store the number of times the short URL has been clicked.\",\n    \"3. Implement the '/shorten' route. This route should accept a POST request with a URL to shorten and an optional custom alias. If a custom alias is provided, check if it already exists in the database. If it does, return an error. If it doesn't, create a new URL with the original URL and the custom alias, and store it in the database. If no custom alias is provided, generate a unique short URL, create a new URL with the original URL and the generated short URL, and store it in the database. Return the shortened URL.\",\n    \"4. Implement the '/<short_url>' route. This route should accept a GET request with a short URL. Retrieve the URL associated with the short URL from the database. If the URL exists and is not expired, increment the click_count field, update the URL in the database, and redirect to the original URL. If the URL doesn't exist or is expired, return an error.\",\n    \"5. Implement the '/stats' route. This route should accept a GET request with a short URL. Retrieve the URL associated with the short URL from the database. If the URL exists, return the click_count field. If the URL doesn't exist, return an error.\",\n    \"6. Implement the '/delete_expired' route. This route should accept a GET request. Retrieve all URLs from the database. For each URL, if the current date and time is later than the expiration_date field, delete the URL from the database. Return a success message.\",\n    \"7. Create a requirements.txt file with the following packages: Flask, SQLAlchemy, pytest.\",\n    \"8. Write tests for all routes and the URL model. Use pytest for testing. The tests should cover all possible scenarios, including but not limited to: successful URL shortening, unsuccessful URL shortening due to a custom alias already existing, successful redirection, unsuccessful redirection due to a short URL not existing or being expired, successful retrieval of click stats, unsuccessful retrieval of click stats due to a short URL not existing, successful deletion of expired URLs.\",\n    \"9. Run the tests using pytest. All tests should pass.\",\n    \"10. Run the Flask application. Test all routes manually by sending requests with different inputs and checking the responses.\"\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}]}
