[{"choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "provide_detailed_sub_task_steps_for_sub_agents", "arguments": "{\n  \"steps\": [\n    \"Step 1: Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new directory for the project and initialize it as a Python project. Create a virtual environment and activate it. Create the main directories and files that will be needed for the project. These include the 'app' directory for the Flask application, 'tests' directory for unit tests, 'static' directory for static files like images and CSS, and 'templates' directory for HTML templates. Also, create the main Python script file 'main.py' which will be the entry point of the application.\",\n    \n    \"Step 2: Install the necessary Python packages. This includes Flask for the web application, Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication, Flask-Login for user authentication, Flask-WTF for forms, Flask-SQLAlchemy for database operations, and Flask-Migrate for database migrations. Also install pytest for testing. Add these packages to a 'requirements.txt' file.\",\n    \n    \"Step 3: Set up the Flask application in 'main.py'. Import the necessary modules and create a Flask app instance. Configure the app with necessary configurations like SECRET_KEY, SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI, etc. Also, initialize the Flask extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, Flask-SocketIO, etc. with the app instance.\",\n    \n    \"Step 4: Create a 'models.py' file in the 'app' directory. This file will contain the database models for the application. Start by creating a User model with fields like id, email, password, profile_picture, status_message, last_seen, etc. Also, create a Message model with fields like id, sender_id, receiver_id, content, timestamp, read, etc. Also, create a Group model with fields like id, name, picture, etc. Also, create a GroupMember model with fields like id, group_id, user_id, admin, etc. Also, create a Contact model with fields like id, user_id, contact_id, blocked, etc. Also, create a Status model with fields like id, user_id, picture, timestamp, etc.\",\n    \n    \"Step 5: Create a 'forms.py' file in the 'app' directory. This file will contain the WTForms forms for the application. Start by creating a RegistrationForm with fields for email and password. Also, create a LoginForm with fields for email and password. Also, create a ProfileForm with fields for profile_picture and status_message. Also, create a ContactForm with fields for contact email. Also, create a MessageForm with fields for content. Also, create a GroupForm with fields for name and picture. Also, create a StatusForm with fields for picture.\",\n    \n    \"Step 6: Create a 'routes.py' file in the 'app' directory. This file will contain the routes for the application. Start by creating a route for the home page which will display the chat interface if the user is logged in or redirect to the login page if not. Also, create routes for user registration, login, logout, profile, contacts, groups, and status. Also, create SocketIO events for sending and receiving messages, creating and managing groups, and posting and viewing statuses.\",\n    \n    \"Step 7: Create HTML templates for the different pages of the application. This includes 'index.html' for the home page, 'register.html' for the registration page, 'login.html' for the login page, 'profile.html' for the profile page, 'contacts.html' for the contacts page, 'groups.html' for the groups page, and 'status.html' for the status page. Use Flask's Jinja2 templating engine to dynamically generate the HTML content based on the data passed from the routes.\",\n    \n    \"Step 8: Create a 'utils.py' file in the 'app' directory. This file will contain utility functions for the application. This includes functions for password hashing and verification, email validation, user authentication, contact management, group management, message encryption and decryption, image uploading and deleting, etc.\",\n    \n    \"Step 9: Create a 'tests' directory and write unit tests for the application. This includes tests for user registration, login, logout, profile update, contact management, group management, messaging, and status posting. Use pytest for writing the tests and use Flask's test client for simulating requests to the application.\",\n    \n    \"Step 10: Run the application and test it. Use Flask's development server for running the application. Test the application by registering a new user, logging in, updating the profile, adding contacts, creating groups, sending messages, and posting statuses. Also, run the unit tests to ensure that all the features are working as expected.\",\n    \n    \"Step 11: After testing, prepare the application for deployment. This includes setting the FLASK_ENV environment variable to 'production', configuring a production WSGI server like Gunicorn, setting up a reverse proxy like Nginx, and configuring a database server like PostgreSQL. Also, create a 'Procfile' for deployment to platforms like Heroku.\",\n    \n    \"Step 12: Deploy the application to a hosting platform. This includes pushing the code to a Git repository, creating a new application on the hosting platform, setting the necessary environment variables, and deploying the application. After deployment, test the application again to ensure that it works correctly in the production environment.\"\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}}]}, {"choices": [{"message": {}}]}]
