You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nNever write any tests for the code.\n                               \nProvide large amounts of code to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data.

The route should display a form for entering the email when accessed with a GET request and process the form data when accessed with a POST request. If a user with the given email exists in the database, generate a password recovery token and send it to the user's email.", "Step 18: Create the PasswordResetForm in the 'forms.py' file. The PasswordResetForm should have a field for the new password and a submit button. Add a method for validating the form data. The method should check if the password recovery token is valid.", "Step 19: Add a route for resetting the password in the 'views.py' file. The route should display the PasswordResetForm when accessed with a GET request and process the form data when accessed with a POST request. If the form data is valid, reset the user's password and redirect the user to the login page.", "Step 20: Create the ProfileForm in the 'forms.py' file. The ProfileForm should have fields for the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings, and a submit button. Add a method for validating the form data. The method should check if the profile picture is an image file and if the privacy settings are valid.", "Step 21: Add a route for editing the user profile in the 'views.py' file. The route should display the ProfileForm when accessed with a GET request and process the form data when accessed with a POST request. If the form data is valid, update the user's profile and redirect the user to the home page.", "Step 22: Add a route for viewing a user's profile in the 'views.py' file. The route should display the user's profile picture, status message, and last seen status. The visibility of these details should depend on the user's privacy settings.", "Step 23: Create the BlockForm in the 'forms.py' file. The BlockForm should have a field for the email of the contact to block or unblock, and a submit button. Add a method for validating the form data. The method should check if a user with the given email exists in the database.", "Step 24: Add a route for blocking and unblocking contacts in the 'views.py' file. The route should display the BlockForm when accessed with a GET request and process the form data when accessed with a POST request. If the form data is valid, block or unblock the contact and redirect the user to the home page.", "Step 25: Create the GroupForm in the 'forms.py' file.
