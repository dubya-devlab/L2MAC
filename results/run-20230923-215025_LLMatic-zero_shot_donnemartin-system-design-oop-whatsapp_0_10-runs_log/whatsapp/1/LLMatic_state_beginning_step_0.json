This class should have attributes for `email`, `password`, `last_seen`, `profile_picture`, `status_message`, and `privacy_settings`. The `User` class should also have methods for `sign_up`, `recover_password`, `set_profile_picture`, `set_status_message`, and `set_privacy_settings`. The `sign_up` method should add the user to a mock database (a dictionary). The `recover_password` method should return the user's password. The `set_profile_picture`, `set_status_message`, and `set_privacy_settings` methods should update the respective attributes. After implementing the `User` class, write a test file named `test_user.py` to test all the methods in the `User` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "2. **Contact Management**: Create a `Contact` class in a file named `contact.py`. This class should have attributes for `user` (an instance of the `User` class), `blocked_contacts` (a list), and `groups` (a list). The `Contact` class should also have methods for `block_contact`, `unblock_contact`, `create_group`, `edit_group`, and `manage_group`. The `block_contact` and `unblock_contact` methods should add and remove users from the `blocked_contacts` list respectively. The `create_group`, `edit_group`, and `manage_group` methods should perform the respective operations on the `groups` list. After implementing the `Contact` class, write a test file named `test_contact.py` to test all the methods in the `Contact` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "3. **Messaging**: Create a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender` (an instance of the `User` class), `receiver` (an instance of the `User` class), `content`, `read_receipt`, `encryption`, and `attachments`. The `Message` class should also have methods for `send_text`, `send_image`, `send_emoji`, `send_gif`, `send_sticker`, and `read_message`. The `send_text`, `send_image`, `send_emoji`, `send_gif`, and `send_sticker` methods should update the `content` and `attachments` attributes and add the message to a mock database (a dictionary). The `read_message` method should update the `read_receipt` attribute. After implementing the `Message` class, write a test file named `test_message.py` to test all the methods in the `Message` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "4. **Group Chats**: Create a `Group` class in a file named `group.py`. This class should have attributes for `name`, `picture`, `participants` (a list), and `admins` (a list). The `Group` class should also have methods for `add_participant`, `remove_participant`, `assign_admin`, and `remove_admin`. The `add_participant`, `remove_participant`, `assign_admin`, and `remove_admin` methods should perform the respective operations on the `participants` and `admins` lists. After implementing the `Group` class, write a test file named `test_group.py` to test all the methods in the `Group` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "5. **Status/Story Feature**: Create a `Status` class in a file named `status.py`. This class should have attributes for `user` (an instance of the `User` class), `content`, `visibility`, and `expiry_time`. The `Status` class should also have a method for `post_status` that updates the `content`, `visibility`, and `expiry_time` attributes and adds the status to a mock database (a dictionary). After implementing the `Status` class, write a test file named `test_status.py` to test the `post_status` method. Run the test to ensure it passes.", "6. **Web Application**: Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This application should have routes for sign up, sign in, recover password, view profile, edit profile, block contact, unblock contact, create group, edit group, manage group, send message, read message, add participant to group, remove participant from group, assign admin to group, remove admin from group, and post status. Each route should call the respective method from the `User`, `Contact`, `Message`, `Group`, and `Status` classes. After implementing the Flask application, write a test file named `test_app.py` to test all the routes. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "7. **Connectivity and Offline Mode**: Implement a `connectivity` attribute for the `User` class that indicates whether the user is online or offline. Also, implement a `queue` attribute for the `Message` class that stores messages when the receiver is offline. The `send_text`, `send_image`, `send_emoji`, `send_gif`, and `send_sticker` methods of the `Message` class should add messages to the `queue` when the receiver is offline. The `read_message` method should remove messages from the `queue` when the receiver comes online. After implementing these features, update the `test_user.py` and `test_message.py` files to test them.
