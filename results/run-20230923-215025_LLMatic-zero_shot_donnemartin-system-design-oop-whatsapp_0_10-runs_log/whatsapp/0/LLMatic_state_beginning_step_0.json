This class should have attributes for `email`, `password`, `last_seen`, `profile_picture`, `status_message`, and `privacy_settings`. The `User` class should also have methods for `sign_up`, `recover_password`, `set_profile_picture`, `set_status_message`, and `set_privacy_settings`. The `sign_up` method should add the user to a mock database (a dictionary). The `recover_password` method should return the user's password. The `set_profile_picture`, `set_status_message`, and `set_privacy_settings` methods should update the respective attributes. Write tests in a file named `test_user.py` to ensure that the `User` class and its methods work as expected.", "2. **Contact Management**: Create a `Contact` class in a file named `contact.py`. This class should have attributes for `user` (an instance of the `User` class), `blocked_contacts` (a list), and `groups` (a list). The `Contact` class should also have methods for `block_contact`, `unblock_contact`, `create_group`, `edit_group`, and `manage_group`. The `block_contact` method should add a user to the `blocked_contacts` list. The `unblock_contact` method should remove a user from the `blocked_contacts` list. The `create_group`, `edit_group`, and `manage_group` methods should perform respective operations on the `groups` list. Write tests in a file named `test_contact.py` to ensure that the `Contact` class and its methods work as expected.", "3. **Messaging**: Create a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender` (an instance of the `User` class), `receiver` (an instance of the `User` class), `content`, `read_receipt`, `encryption`, and `attachments`. The `Message` class should also have methods for `send`, `receive`, `read`, `encrypt`, and `attach`. The `send` method should add the message to a mock database (a dictionary). The `receive` method should retrieve the message from the mock database. The `read` method should update the `read_receipt` attribute. The `encrypt` method should encrypt the `content` attribute. The `attach` method should add an attachment to the `attachments` list. Write tests in a file named `test_message.py` to ensure that the `Message` class and its methods work as expected.", "4. **Group Chats**: Create a `GroupChat` class in a file named `group_chat.py`. This class should have attributes for `name`, `picture`, `participants` (a list), and `admin_roles` (a dictionary). The `GroupChat` class should also have methods for `add_participant`, `remove_participant`, `set_admin_role`, and `remove_admin_role`. The `add_participant` and `remove_participant` methods should perform respective operations on the `participants` list. The `set_admin_role` and `remove_admin_role` methods should perform respective operations on the `admin_roles` dictionary. Write tests in a file named `test_group_chat.py` to ensure that the `GroupChat` class and its methods work as expected.", "5. **Status/Story Feature**: Create a `Status` class in a file named `status.py`. This class should have attributes for `user` (an instance of the `User` class), `image`, `visibility`, and `expiry_time`. The `Status` class should also have methods for `post`, `view`, and `set_visibility`. The `post` method should add the status to a mock database (a dictionary). The `view` method should retrieve the status from the mock database. The `set_visibility` method should update the `visibility` attribute. Write tests in a file named `test_status.py` to ensure that the `Status` class and its methods work as expected.", "6. **Web Application**: Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This application should have routes for user registration, user authentication, profile management, contact management, messaging, group chats, and status/story feature. Each route should use the respective classes and methods created in the previous steps. Write tests in a file named `test_app.py` to ensure that the Flask application and its routes work as expected.", "7. **Connectivity and Offline Mode**: Modify the `Message` class to include a `queue` attribute (a list) and a `send_offline` method. The `send_offline` method should add the message to the `queue` list when the user is offline, and send the message when the user is online. Also, modify the `User` class to include an `online` attribute and a `set_online_status` method. The `set_online_status` method should update the `online` attribute. Write additional tests in the `test_message.py` and `test_user.py` files to ensure that the modifications work as expected."], "step": "1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Start by creating a `User` class in a file named `user.py`.
