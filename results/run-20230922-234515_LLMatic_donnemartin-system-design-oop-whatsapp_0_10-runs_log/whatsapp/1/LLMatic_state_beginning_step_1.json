Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies. The main dependencies will be Flask for the web application, Pytest for testing, and sqlite3 for the database. Write the requirements.txt file with these dependencies and run pip install -r requirements.txt to install them.", "2. **User Registration and Authentication**: In the models folder, create a user.py file. Define a User class with fields for id, email, password, and profile picture. The id will be a unique identifier, the email and password will be used for authentication, and the profile picture will be a URL to the image file. Also, create a user_service.py file in the services folder. Define functions for registering a new user (register_user) and authenticating a user (authenticate_user). The register_user function should take an email and password, create a new User instance, and save it to the database. The authenticate_user function should take an email and password, retrieve the User with the given email from the database, and check if the password matches. If it does, return the User, otherwise return None. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "3. **User Profile**: In the User class, add fields for status message and privacy settings. The status message will be a string, and the privacy settings will be a dictionary with keys for 'details' and 'last seen' and boolean values. In the user_service.py file, add functions for setting a profile picture (set_profile_picture), setting a status message (set_status_message), and updating privacy settings (update_privacy_settings). The set_profile_picture function should take a user id and a picture URL, update the User's profile picture, and save the changes to the database. The set_status_message function should take a user id and a message, update the User's status message, and save the changes to the database. The update_privacy_settings function should take a user id and a dictionary of settings, update the User's privacy settings, and save the changes to the database. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "4. **Contact Management**: Create a contact.py file in the models folder. Define a Contact class with fields for id, user id, contact id, and blocked. The user id and contact id will be foreign keys to the User table, and blocked will be a boolean indicating if the contact is blocked. Also, create a contact_service.py file in the services folder. Define functions for blocking a contact (block_contact), unblocking a contact (unblock_contact), and getting a user's contacts (get_contacts). The block_contact function should take a user id and a contact id, retrieve the Contact with the given ids from the database, set blocked to True, and save the changes to the database. The unblock_contact function should do the same but set blocked to False. The get_contacts function should take a user id and return a list of Contacts for the user. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "5. **Messaging**: Create a message.py file in the models folder. Define a Message class with fields for id, sender id, receiver id, text, read, and timestamp. The sender id and receiver id will be foreign keys to the User table, the text will be the message content, read will be a boolean indicating if the message has been read, and timestamp will be the time the message was sent. Also, create a message_service.py file in the services folder. Define functions for sending a message (send_message), marking a message as read (mark_as_read), and getting a user's messages (get_messages). The send_message function should take a sender id, a receiver id, and a text, create a new Message instance, and save it to the database. The mark_as_read function should take a message id, retrieve the Message with the given id from the database, set read to True, and save the changes to the database. The get_messages function should take a user id and return a list of Messages for the user. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "6. **Group Chats**: Create a group.py file in the models folder. Define a Group class with fields for id, name, picture, and admin id. The name will be the group name, the picture will be a URL to the image file, and the admin id will be a foreign key to the User table. Also, define a GroupMember class with fields for id, group id, user id, and admin. The group id and user id will be foreign keys to the Group and User tables respectively, and admin will be a boolean indicating if the user is an admin of the group. Also, create a group_service.py file in the services folder. Define functions for creating a group (create_group), adding a member to a group (add_member), removing a member from a group (remove_member), and getting a user's groups (get_groups). The create_group function should take a name, a picture, and an admin id, create a new Group instance, and save it to the database. The add_member and remove_member functions should take a group id and a user id, create or delete a GroupMember instance respectively, and save the changes to the database. The get_groups function should take a user id and return a list of Groups for the user. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "7. **Status/Story Feature**: In the User class, add a field for status. The status will be a dictionary with keys for 'image', 'text', and 'timestamp' and values for the status image URL, the status text, and the time the status was posted. In the user_service.py file, add a function for posting a status (post_status). The post_status function should take a user id, an image, and a text, update the User's status, and save the changes to the database. Write tests for this function and run them to ensure it works correctly.", "8. **Web Application**: Create a web.py file in the root of the project. Import Flask and define a Flask application. Define routes for the user registration, user authentication, user profile, contact management, messaging, group chats, and status/story feature. Each route should call the corresponding function in the service layer and return a JSON response. Write tests for these routes and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "9. **Connectivity and Offline Mode**: In the message_service.py file, add a function for queuing messages (queue_message). The queue_message function should take a sender id, a receiver id, and a text, create a new Message instance with read set to False, and save it to the database. When the receiver is online, the get_messages function should return the queued messages. In the User class, add a field for online. The online will be a boolean indicating if the user is online. In the user_service.py file, add functions for setting a user online (set_online) and offline (set_offline). The set_online and set_offline functions should take a user id, update the User's online status, and save the changes to the database. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "10. **Final Testing and Deployment**: Run all the tests to ensure that all the features work correctly. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues. Once all the tests pass, deploy the application to a server. Test the deployed application to ensure that it works correctly in the production environment."], "step": "1. **Setup the project structure**: Create a new Python project with the following structure: a main.py file as the entry point, a models folder for data models, a services folder for business logic, a utils folder for utility functions, and a tests folder for test cases.
