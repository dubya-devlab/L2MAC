Each route should call the corresponding function in the service layer and return a JSON response. Write tests for these routes and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "9. **Connectivity and Offline Mode**: In the message_service.py file, add a function for queuing messages (queue_message). The queue_message function should take a sender id, a receiver id, and a text, create a new Message instance with read set to False, and save it to the database. When the receiver is online, the get_messages function should return the queued messages. In the User class, add a field for online. The online will be a boolean indicating if the user is online.

Define a Contact class with fields for id, user id, contact id, and blocked. The user id and contact id will be foreign keys to the User table, and blocked will be a boolean indicating if the contact is blocked. Also, create a contact_service.py file in the services folder. Define functions for blocking a contact (block_contact), unblocking a contact (unblock_contact), and getting a user's contacts (get_contacts). The block_contact function should take a user id and a contact id, retrieve the Contact with the given ids from the database, set blocked to True, and save the changes to the database. The unblock_contact function should do the same but set blocked to False. The get_contacts function should take a user id and return a list of Contacts for the user.

Define a Contact class with fields for id, user id, contact id, and blocked. The user id and contact id will be foreign keys to the User table, and blocked will be a boolean indicating if the contact is blocked. Also, create a contact_service.py file in the services folder. Define functions for blocking a contact (block_contact), unblocking a contact (unblock_contact), and getting a user's contacts (get_contacts). The block_contact function should take a user id and a contact id, retrieve the Contact with the given ids from the database, set blocked to True, and save the changes to the database. The unblock_contact function should do the same but set blocked to False. The get_contacts function should take a user id and return a list of Contacts for the user. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they work correctly.\n``` \n\n If yes, return ACCEPT, otherwise reflect and return the full complete corrected code to complete the task, use the defined functions to write the code.
