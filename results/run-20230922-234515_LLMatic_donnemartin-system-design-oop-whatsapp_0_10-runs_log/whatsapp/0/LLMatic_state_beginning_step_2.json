Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The main dependencies will be Flask for the web application, Pytest for testing, and sqlite3 for the database. Write the requirements.txt file with these dependencies and run pip install -r requirements.txt to install them.", "2. **User Registration and Authentication**: In the models directory, create a user.py file to define a User data class with fields for id, email, password, and other user details. In the services directory, create an auth.py file to define functions for user registration and password recovery. The registration function should take an email and password, create a new User instance, hash the password, and save the user to the database. The password recovery function should take an email, generate a password reset token, and send it to the user's email. Write tests for these functions and run them with pytest.", "3. **User Profile**: In the user.py file, add fields to the User data class for profile picture and status message. In the auth.py file, define functions for setting the profile picture and status message. These functions should take a user id and the new picture or message, update the corresponding User instance, and save it to the database. Also, define a function for setting privacy settings, which should take a user id and a privacy level, and update the User instance accordingly. Write tests for these functions and run them with pytest.", "4. **Contact Management**: In the models directory, create a contact.py file to define a Contact data class with fields for user id, contact id, and blocked status. In the services directory, create a contact.py file to define functions for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. These functions should update the corresponding Contact instances and save them to the database. Write tests for these functions and run them with pytest.", "5. **Messaging**: In the models directory, create a message.py file to define a Message data class with fields for sender id, receiver id, text, read status, and encryption key. In the services directory, create a message.py file to define functions for sending and receiving messages, and for sharing images. These functions should create new Message instances and save them to the database. Also, define a function for sending emojis, GIFs, and stickers, which should take a user id, a receiver id, and an emoji, GIF, or sticker, and send it as a message. Write tests for these functions and run them with pytest.", "6. **Group Chats**: In the models directory, create a group.py file to define a Group data class with fields for id, name, picture, and admin id, and a GroupMember data class with fields for group id and user id. In the services directory, create a group.py file to define functions for creating groups, adding and removing participants, and setting admin roles and permissions. These functions should create or update the corresponding Group and GroupMember instances and save them to the database. Write tests for these functions and run them with pytest.", "7. **Status/Story Feature**: In the models directory, create a status.py file to define a Status data class with fields for user id, image, and visibility. In the services directory, create a status.py file to define functions for posting statuses and setting visibility. These functions should create new Status instances and save them to the database. Write tests for these functions and run them with pytest.", "8. **Web Application**: In the main.py file, create a Flask application and define routes for the various services. Use the Flask render_template function to return HTML templates for the different pages, and the Flask request object to handle form submissions. Write tests for the routes and run them with pytest.", "9. **Connectivity and Offline Mode**: In the utils directory, create a connectivity.py file to define functions for checking internet connectivity and handling offline mode. These functions should queue messages when the user is offline and send them when connectivity is restored, and update the user's online/offline status. Write tests for these functions and run them with pytest.", "10. **Final Testing and Deployment**: Run all tests with pytest to ensure that all features are working as expected.
