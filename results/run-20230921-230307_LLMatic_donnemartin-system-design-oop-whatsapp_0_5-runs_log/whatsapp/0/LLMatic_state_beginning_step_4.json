Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "provide_detailed_sub_task_steps_for_sub_agents", "arguments": "{\n  \"steps\": [\n    \"1. Identify the core components of the system based on the requirements. These will include User, Chat, Message, Group, Status, and WebApp classes. Each of these classes will have associated methods to handle the various functionalities required.\",\n    \"2. Start with the User class. This will handle user registration, authentication, profile management, and contact management. Write the User class with methods for registration, login, password recovery, profile picture and status setting, privacy setting, and contact blocking/unblocking. Write tests to ensure these methods work as expected.\",\n    \"3. Next, write the Chat class. This will handle the messaging functionality. It will need methods for sending and receiving messages, read receipts, encryption, and image sharing. Write tests to ensure these methods work as expected.\",\n    \"4. Write the Message class. This will represent individual messages and will need methods for handling text, images, emojis, GIFs, and stickers. Write tests to ensure these methods work as expected.\",\n    \"5. Write the Group class. This will handle group chats. It will need methods for creating groups, adding/removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. Write tests to ensure these methods work as expected.\",\n    \"6. Write the Status class. This will handle the status/story feature. It will need methods for posting statuses, setting visibility, and handling the time limit. Write tests to ensure these methods work as expected.\",\n    \"7. Write the WebApp class. This will handle the web application functionality. It will need methods for displaying the user interface and handling user interactions. Write tests to ensure these methods work as expected.\",\n    \"8. Finally, handle connectivity and offline mode. This will involve modifying the Chat and WebApp classes to queue messages when offline and send them when connectivity is restored, and to display online/offline status. Write tests to ensure these modifications work as expected.\",\n    \"9. Once all classes and methods have been written and tested, integrate them into a complete system. Write integration tests to ensure the system as a whole works as expected.\",\n    \"10. Write the entrypoint file that will run the application. This will involve instantiating the necessary classes and calling the appropriate methods based on user input. Write tests to ensure the entrypoint file works as expected.\"\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}]}
