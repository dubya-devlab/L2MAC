Add routes in `app.py` for creating groups, adding/removing participants, and managing admin roles. The creating route should add a new `Group` to the `groups` dictionary, the adding/removing participants route should update the `participants` field of the `Group` class, and the admin roles route should update the `admin` field of the `Group` class. Create a test file `test_groups.py` in the `tests` directory to test the creating, adding/removing participants, and admin roles routes.

The `Status` class should have fields for `id`, `user`, `content`, `visibility`, and `timestamp`. Add a `statuses` dictionary in `app.py` to act as an in-memory database of statuses. Add routes in `app.py` for posting statuses and updating status visibility. The posting route should add a new `Status` to the `statuses` dictionary and the visibility route should update the `visibility` field of the `Status` class. Create a test file `test_status.py` in the `tests` directory to test the posting and visibility routes.

Add a `queue` field to the `User` class to represent the user's message queue. Add routes in `app.py` for updating the user's connectivity status and managing the message queue. The connectivity route should update the `connectivity` field of the `User` class and the message queue route should update the `queue` field of the `User` class. Create a test file `test_connectivity.py` in the `tests` directory to test the connectivity and message queue routes. Run the Flask application and the tests to ensure the connectivity and offline mode functionality is working correctly. \n\n Note: Condition any new code files on the existing code files: ['app.py', 'requirements.txt', 'tests/test_app.py', 'models.py', 'tests/test_user.py', 'tests/test_profile.py', 'tests/test_contacts.py', 'tests/test_messages.py', 'tests/test_groups.py', 'templates/index.html', 'static/styles.css', 'tests/test_web.py', 'tests/test_connectivity.py'] Fully implement these features in the code, no placeholders. You can now optionally view the existing files if you need to view them to complete the current task step. You have a limited context window so be selective about which files you view, only view the files you think you might need to view. \n\n The necessary files to view are \"app.py\", \"models.py\", and \"tests/test_connectivity.py\". The tests for connectivity and offline mode have been updated to correct the function calls.\n\nRespond now only with a function call of one of the following functions provided: `sub_task_step_complete`, `view_files`, `run_python_file`, `pytest_files`, `write_files`, `delete_files`, and if you want to output code only use the `write_files` function to output code.\n"}], "message_hash": "12a89112e2a729a2f5e62d534f3455cce69fd056497c480fddac4a7e917e567f"}
