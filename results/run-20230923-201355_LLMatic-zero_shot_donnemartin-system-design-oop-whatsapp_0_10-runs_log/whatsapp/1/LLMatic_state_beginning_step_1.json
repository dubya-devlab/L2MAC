Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. The main files will include `app.py` (the main entry point of the application), `requirements.txt` (to manage the project dependencies), and a `tests` directory (to hold all the test files). Write the basic Flask application in `app.py` and add Flask to `requirements.txt`. Create a test file `test_app.py` in the `tests` directory to test the basic Flask application. Run the Flask application and the tests to ensure everything is setup correctly.", "2. **User Registration and Authentication**: Create a `User` dataclass in a new file `models.py` to represent a user. The `User` class should have fields for `id`, `email`, `password`, `profile_picture`, `status_message`, `privacy_settings`, `contacts`, `blocked_contacts`, `groups`, `messages`, `status`, and `last_seen`.
