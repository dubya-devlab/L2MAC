Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.

**Setup the Project**: Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. The main files will include `app.py` (the main entry point of the application), `requirements.txt` (to manage the project dependencies), and a `tests` directory (to hold all the test files). Write the basic Flask application in `app.py` and add Flask to `requirements.txt`. Create a test file `test_app.py` in the `tests` directory to test the basic Flask application. Run the Flask application and the tests to ensure everything is setup correctly.", "2. **User Registration and Authentication**: Create a `User` dataclass in a new file `models.py` to represent a user. The `User` class should have fields for `id`, `email`, `password`, `profile_picture`, `status_message`, `privacy_settings`, `contacts`, `blocked_contacts`, `groups`, `messages`, `status`, and `last_seen`. Create a `users` dictionary in `app.py` to act as an in-memory database of users. Add routes in `app.py` for user registration and password recovery. The registration route should add a new `User` to the `users` dictionary and the password recovery route should return a message indicating that a password recovery email has been sent. Create a test file `test_user.py` in the `tests` directory to test the user registration and password recovery routes. Run the Flask application and the tests to ensure the user registration and password recovery functionality is working correctly.", "3. **User Profile**: Add routes in `app.py` for setting a profile picture, setting a status message, and updating privacy settings. The profile picture route should update the `profile_picture` field of the `User` class, the status message route should update the `status_message` field of the `User` class, and the privacy settings route should update the `privacy_settings` field of the `User` class. Create a test file `test_profile.py` in the `tests` directory to test the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings routes. Run the Flask application and the tests to ensure the user profile functionality is working correctly.", "4. **Contact Management**: Add routes in `app.py` for blocking/unblocking contacts and managing groups. The blocking route should add a contact to the `blocked_contacts` field of the `User` class, the unblocking route should remove a contact from the `blocked_contacts` field of the `User` class, and the groups route should update the `groups` field of the `User` class. Create a test file `test_contacts.py` in the `tests` directory to test the blocking/unblocking and groups routes. Run the Flask application and the tests to ensure the contact management functionality is working correctly.", "5. **Messaging**: Create a `Message` dataclass in `models.py` to represent a message. The `Message` class should have fields for `id`, `sender`, `receiver`, `content`, `timestamp`, `read_receipt`, and `encryption`. Add a `messages` dictionary in `app.py` to act as an in-memory database of messages. Add routes in `app.py` for sending/receiving messages, updating read receipts, and sharing images. The sending route should add a new `Message` to the `messages` dictionary, the receiving route should return the `Message` from the `messages` dictionary, the read receipts route should update the `read_receipt` field of the `Message` class, and the image sharing route should update the `content` field of the `Message` class with an image. Create a test file `test_messages.py` in the `tests` directory to test the sending/receiving, read receipts, and image sharing routes. Run the Flask application and the tests to ensure the messaging functionality is working correctly.", "6. **Group Chats**: Add a `Group` dataclass in `models.py` to represent a group chat. The `Group` class should have fields for `id`, `name`, `picture`, `participants`, and `admin`. Add a `groups` dictionary in `app.py` to act as an in-memory database of groups. Add routes in `app.py` for creating groups, adding/removing participants, and managing admin roles. The creating route should add a new `Group` to the `groups` dictionary, the adding/removing participants route should update the `participants` field of the `Group` class, and the admin roles route should update the `admin` field of the `Group` class. Create a test file `test_groups.py` in the `tests` directory to test the creating, adding/removing participants, and admin roles routes. Run the Flask application and the tests to ensure the group chats functionality is working correctly.", "7. **Status/Story Feature**: Add a `Status` dataclass in `models.py` to represent a status. The `Status` class should have fields for `id`, `user`, `content`, `visibility`, and `timestamp`. Add a `statuses` dictionary in `app.py` to act as an in-memory database of statuses. Add routes in `app.py` for posting statuses and updating status visibility. The posting route should add a new `Status` to the `statuses` dictionary and the visibility route should update the `visibility` field of the `Status` class. Create a test file `test_status.py` in the `tests` directory to test the posting and visibility routes. Run the Flask application and the tests to ensure the status/story feature is working correctly.", "8. **Web Application**: Create a `templates` directory to hold the HTML templates for the web application. Create a `static` directory to hold the static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) for the web application. Add routes in `app.py` to render the HTML templates. Create a test file `test_web.py` in the `tests` directory to test the rendering of the HTML templates. Run the Flask application and the tests to ensure the web application is working correctly.", "9. **Connectivity and Offline Mode**: Add a `connectivity` field to the `User` class to represent the user's connectivity status. Add a `queue` field to the `User` class to represent the user's message queue. Add routes in `app.py` for updating the user's connectivity status and managing the message queue. The connectivity route should update the `connectivity` field of the `User` class and the message queue route should update the `queue` field of the `User` class. Create a test file `test_connectivity.py` in the `tests` directory to test the connectivity and message queue routes. Run the Flask application and the tests to ensure the connectivity and offline mode functionality is working correctly."], "step": "7. **Status/Story Feature**: Add a `Status` dataclass in `models.py` to represent a status.

Add routes in `app.py` for posting statuses and updating status visibility. The posting route should add a new `Status` to the `statuses` dictionary and the visibility route should update the `visibility` field of the `Status` class.
