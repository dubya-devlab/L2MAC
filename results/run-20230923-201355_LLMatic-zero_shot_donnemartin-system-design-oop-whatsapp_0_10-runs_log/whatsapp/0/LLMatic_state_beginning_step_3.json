The `User` class should also have methods for `sign_up`, `recover_password`, `set_profile_picture`, `set_status_message`, and `set_privacy_settings`. The `sign_up` method should add a new user to a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). The `recover_password` method should simulate password recovery by returning a success message. The `set_profile_picture`, `set_status_message`, and `set_privacy_settings` methods should update the respective user attributes. After implementing the `User` class, write a test file named `test_user.py` to test all the methods in the `User` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "2. **Contact Management**: Create a `Contact` class in a file named `contact.py`. This class should have attributes for `user` (an instance of the `User` class), `blocked_contacts` (a list of `User` instances), and `groups` (a list of `Group` instances). The `Contact` class should also have methods for `block_contact`, `unblock_contact`, `create_group`, `edit_group`, and `manage_group`. The `block_contact` and `unblock_contact` methods should add and remove users from the `blocked_contacts` list respectively. The `create_group`, `edit_group`, and `manage_group` methods should perform respective operations on the `groups` list. After implementing the `Contact` class, write a test file named `test_contact.py` to test all the methods in the `Contact` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "3. **Messaging**: Create a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender` (an instance of the `User` class), `receiver` (an instance of the `User` class), `content`, `read_receipt`, `encryption`, and `attachments`. The `Message` class should also have methods for `send_text`, `send_image`, `send_emoji`, `send_gif`, and `send_sticker`. The `send_text` method should add a new message to a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). The `send_image`, `send_emoji`, `send_gif`, and `send_sticker` methods should simulate sending respective types of messages by returning success messages. After implementing the `Message` class, write a test file named `test_message.py` to test all the methods in the `Message` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "4. **Group Chats**: Create a `Group` class in a file named `group.py`. This class should have attributes for `name`, `picture`, `participants` (a list of `User` instances), `admins` (a list of `User` instances), and `messages` (a list of `Message` instances).

The `Status` class should also have a method for `post_status` that adds a new status to a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). After implementing the `Status` class, write a test file named `test_status.py` to test the `post_status` method. Run the test to ensure it passes.", "6. **Web Application**: Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This application should have routes for user registration, password recovery, profile settings, contact management, messaging, group chats, and status posting. Each route should call the respective method from the `User`, `Contact`, `Message`, `Group`, and `Status` classes. After implementing the Flask application, write a test file named `test_app.py` to test all the routes. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "7. **Connectivity and Offline Mode**: Add a `connectivity` attribute to the `User` class. This attribute should be a boolean that indicates whether the user is online or offline. Also, add a `queue` attribute to the `Message` class. This attribute should be a list that stores messages when the user is offline. The messages should be sent when the user comes back online. After making these changes, update the test files `test_user.py` and `test_message.py` to test the new functionality. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "8. **Module Dependency**: Create a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the Python packages required for the project. This file should include Flask and pytest at a minimum.", "9. **Package the Project**: Organize the Python files into a package structure following best practices. Update the import statements in the files as necessary. After packaging the project, run all the tests again to ensure they all pass."], "step": "4. **Group Chats**: Create a `Group` class in a file named `group.py`.

When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persis between steps or write operations.\n\nUse the functions provided.

Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass. Please be sure to include all of the specified feature requirements in the following plan.\n"}], "message_hash": "b157aecd598dba5a9683257d0d703fa407ba17b604f63395e8121ad10d07c2ae"}
