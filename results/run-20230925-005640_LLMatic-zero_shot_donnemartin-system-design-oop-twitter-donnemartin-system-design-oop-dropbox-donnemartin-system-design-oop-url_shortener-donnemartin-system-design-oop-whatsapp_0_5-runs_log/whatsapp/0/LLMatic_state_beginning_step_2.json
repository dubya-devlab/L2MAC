This class should have attributes for `email`, `password`, `last_seen`, `profile_picture`, `status_message`, and `privacy_settings`. The `User` class should also have methods for `sign_up`, `recover_password`, `set_profile_picture`, `set_status_message`, and `set_privacy_settings`. The `sign_up` method should check if the email is already in use. If it is, it should return an error message. If it's not, it should add the user to the database and return a success message. The `recover_password` method should send a password recovery email to the user's email address. The `set_profile_picture`, `set_status_message`, and `set_privacy_settings` methods should update the corresponding user attributes. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_user.py` to test all the methods in the `User` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "2. **Contact Management**: Create a `Contact` class in a file named `contact.py`. This class should have attributes for `user` (the user who owns the contact), `contact` (the user who is the contact), and `blocked`. The `Contact` class should also have methods for `block` and `unblock`. The `block` method should set the `blocked` attribute to `True`, and the `unblock` method should set it to `False`. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_contact.py` to test all the methods in the `Contact` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "3. **Messaging**: Create a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender`, `receiver`, `content`, `timestamp`, `read_receipt`, and `encrypted`. The `Message` class should also have methods for `send`, `receive`, `encrypt`, and `decrypt`. The `send` method should add the message to the database and update the `timestamp`. The `receive` method should update the `read_receipt` attribute. The `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods should encrypt and decrypt the `content` attribute, respectively. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_message.py` to test all the methods in the `Message` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "4. **Group Chats**: Create a `Group` class in a file named `group.py`. This class should have attributes for `name`, `picture`, `participants`, and `admins`. The `Group` class should also have methods for `add_participant`, `remove_participant`, `promote_to_admin`, and `demote_from_admin`. The `add_participant` and `remove_participant` methods should add and remove users from the `participants` list, respectively. The `promote_to_admin` and `demote_from_admin` methods should add and remove users from the `admins` list, respectively. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_group.py` to test all the methods in the `Group` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "5. **Status/Story Feature**: Create a `Status` class in a file named `status.py`. This class should have attributes for `user`, `content`, `timestamp`, and `visibility`. The `Status` class should also have a method for `post`. The `post` method should add the status to the database and update the `timestamp`. After implementing this method, write a test file named `test_status.py` to test the `post` method in the `Status` class. Run the test to ensure it passes.", "6. **Web Application**: Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This application should have routes for signing up, logging in, recovering password, setting profile picture, setting status message, setting privacy settings, blocking and unblocking contacts, sending and receiving messages, creating and managing groups, and posting statuses. Each route should call the corresponding method in the `User`, `Contact`, `Message`, `Group`, or `Status` class. After implementing these routes, write a test file named `test_app.py` to test all the routes in the Flask application. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "7. **Connectivity and Offline Mode**: Modify the `Message` class to add a `queued` attribute. If a message is sent while the receiver is offline, the `queued` attribute should be set to `True`. When the receiver comes online, all queued messages should be sent. Modify the `User` class to add an `online` attribute. This attribute should be set to `True` when the user is online and `False` when the user is offline. After implementing these modifications, update the `test_message.py` and `test_user.py` files to test the new functionality. Run the tests to ensure they all pass."], "step": "3. **Messaging**: Create a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender`, `receiver`, `content`, `timestamp`, `read_receipt`, and `encrypted`. The `Message` class should also have methods for `send`, `receive`, `encrypt`, and `decrypt`. The `send` method should add the message to the database and update the `timestamp`. The `receive` method should update the `read_receipt` attribute. The `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods should encrypt and decrypt the `content` attribute, respectively.
