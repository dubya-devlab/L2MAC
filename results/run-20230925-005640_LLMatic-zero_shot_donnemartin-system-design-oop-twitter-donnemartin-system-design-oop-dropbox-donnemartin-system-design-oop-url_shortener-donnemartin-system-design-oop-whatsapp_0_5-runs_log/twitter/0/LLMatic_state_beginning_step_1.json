Create a new Python Flask project and install necessary dependencies such as Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended for JWT based authentication, Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM, pytest for testing, and other necessary libraries. Create a requirements.txt file to manage these dependencies. Also, setup pytest for running tests. Write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and all the necessary dependencies are installed correctly. Run the test to verify the setup.", "2. **Design the database schema:** Design the database schema for the application. The schema should include tables for Users, Posts, Comments, Likes, Follows, Messages, Notifications, and Trends. Each table should have appropriate fields based on the requirements. For example, the Users table should have fields for email, username, password, profile picture, bio, website link, and location. The Posts table should have fields for user_id, content, image, and timestamp. Similarly, design the other tables. Write a test to ensure that the database schema is designed correctly. Run the test to verify the schema.", "3. **Implement User Registration and Authentication:** Implement the functionality for user registration and authentication. Users should be able to register using email, username, and password. Implement secure authentication using JWT.
