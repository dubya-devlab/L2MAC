Create a new Python Flask project and install necessary dependencies such as Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended for JWT based authentication, Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM, Flask-Migrate for database migration, and pytest for testing. Create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the dependencies. Write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and all the dependencies are installed correctly.", "2. **Design the database schema:** Design the database schema for the application. The schema should include tables for Users, Posts, Comments, Likes, Retweets, Follows, Messages, Notifications, and Trends. Each table should have appropriate fields according to the requirements. For example, the Users table should have fields for email, username, password, profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Write a test to ensure that the database schema is designed correctly and all tables and fields exist.", "3. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the functionality for user registration and authentication. Users should be able to register using email, username, and password. Implement secure authentication using JWT. Write a test to ensure that the registration and authentication functionality works correctly and securely.", "4. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the functionality for profile management. Users should be able to edit their profile information including profile picture, bio, website link, and location. They should also have the option to make their profile private or public. Write a test to ensure that the profile management functionality works correctly.", "5. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the functionality for creating, deleting, and interacting with posts. Users should be able to create text-based posts with a limit of 280 characters and have the option to include images in their posts. They should also be able to delete their own posts. Implement the functionality for users to like, retweet, and reply to posts. Write a test to ensure that the posting and content management functionality works correctly.", "6. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the functionality for content filtering and search. Users should be able to search for specific posts or users using keywords. They should also have the option to filter content based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. Write a test to ensure that the content filtering and search functionality works correctly.", "7. **Implement Social Interaction:** Implement the functionality for following and unfollowing users. A timeline view should display posts from followed users. Users should receive notifications for new followers. Implement the functionality for direct messaging between users and the option to block/unblock users from messaging. Write a test to ensure that the social interaction functionality works correctly.", "8. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the functionality for notifications. Users should be notified of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions. Write a test to ensure that the notifications functionality works correctly.", "9. **Implement Trending & Discovery:** Implement the functionality for identifying and displaying trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. Trending topics should be sortable based on location or globally. Implement the functionality for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write a test to ensure that the trending and discovery functionality works correctly.", "10. **Final Testing & Debugging:** After implementing all the functionalities, perform a final round of testing to ensure that all parts of the application work together correctly. Debug any issues that arise during testing. Write a comprehensive test suite that covers all functionalities of the application."], "step": "3. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the functionality for user registration and authentication.

Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass. Please be sure to include all of the specified feature requirements in the following plan.\n"}], "message_hash": "ee467a01569277a7a2828f74d632ac705a8e296acab68b31828ea8352adf4216"}
