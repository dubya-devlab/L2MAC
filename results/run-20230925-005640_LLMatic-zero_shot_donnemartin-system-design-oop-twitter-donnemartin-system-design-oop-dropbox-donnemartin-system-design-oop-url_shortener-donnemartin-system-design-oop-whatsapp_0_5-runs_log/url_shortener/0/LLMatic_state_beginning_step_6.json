Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and set up the necessary files and directories. The project structure should include the following files and directories: main.py (the entry point of the application), models.py (for database models), views.py (for handling HTTP requests), services.py (for business logic), tests/ (a directory for test files), and requirements.txt (for project dependencies). Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store data. Write tests to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and that the mock database is functioning as expected.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. In the models.py file, define a URL model with fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, and the user who created it. In the services.py file, create a function to generate a unique shortened URL. This function should take a URL as input, validate that the URL is active and legitimate, and then generate a unique shortened URL. If the user chooses a custom short link, the function should check for its availability and use it if it's available. In the views.py file, create an HTTP endpoint for users to input a URL to be shortened. This endpoint should call the URL shortening function from the services.py file. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature is working correctly.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. In the views.py file, create an HTTP endpoint for the shortened URLs. When this endpoint is accessed, it should look up the original URL from the mock database and redirect the user to it. Write tests to ensure that the redirection feature is working correctly.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. In the models.py file, define a Click model with fields for the URL, the date/time of the click, and the geographical location of the clicker. In the services.py file, create a function to record a click when a shortened URL is accessed. This function should create a new Click object and save it to the mock database. Also, create a function to retrieve the analytics for a given URL. This function should return the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of each clicker. In the views.py file, create an HTTP endpoint for users to view the analytics for their shortened URLs. This endpoint should call the analytics retrieval function from the services.py file. Write tests to ensure that the analytics feature is working correctly.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. In the models.py file, define a User model with fields for the username, password, and a list of URLs. In the services.py file, create functions to create, edit, and delete user accounts, as well as to add, edit, and delete URLs from a user's account. In the views.py file, create HTTP endpoints for these functions. Write tests to ensure that the user accounts feature is working correctly.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. In the services.py file, create functions for administrators to view all URLs and user accounts, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. In the views.py file, create HTTP endpoints for these functions. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature is working correctly.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. In the models.py file, add a field to the URL model for the expiration date/time. In the services.py file, modify the URL shortening function to accept an optional expiration date/time. If provided, this should be saved with the URL. Also, modify the redirection function to check the expiration date/time before redirecting. If the URL has expired, it should return an error instead of redirecting. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature is working correctly.", "8.
