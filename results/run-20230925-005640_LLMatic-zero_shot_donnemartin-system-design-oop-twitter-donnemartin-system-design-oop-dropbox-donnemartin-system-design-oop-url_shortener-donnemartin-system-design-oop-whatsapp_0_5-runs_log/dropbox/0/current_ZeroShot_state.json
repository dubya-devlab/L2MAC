You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persis between steps or write operations.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nYou will get instructions for code to write.\nFirst lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.\nDo not comment on what every file does.

Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only output all code now, which includes writing tests.\n"}], "base_dialog": [], "sub_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "write_files", "arguments": "{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"requirements.txt\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"flask\\npytest\\ndataclasses\\nflask-login\\nflask-wtf\\nwerkzeug\\n\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.
