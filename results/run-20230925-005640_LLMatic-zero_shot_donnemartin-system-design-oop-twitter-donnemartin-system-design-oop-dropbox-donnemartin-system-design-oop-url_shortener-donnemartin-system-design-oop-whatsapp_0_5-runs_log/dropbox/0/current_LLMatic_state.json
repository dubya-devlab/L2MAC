The __repr__ method will return a string representation of the folder. Write tests to ensure that the Folder model is working correctly.", "5. Implement the user registration functionality. This will involve creating a new route in the Flask application that handles POST requests to '/register'. This route will accept JSON data containing the user's name, email, and password. It will create a new User object, set the password using the set_password method, and save the user to the database. It will then return a success message and the user's id. Write tests to ensure that the user registration functionality is working correctly.", "6. Implement the user login functionality. This will involve creating a new route in the Flask application that handles POST requests to '/login'. This route will accept JSON data containing the user's email and password. It will retrieve the user from the database using the email, check the password using the check_password method, and return a success message and the user's id if the password is correct. If the password is incorrect, it will return an error message. Write tests to ensure that the user login functionality is working correctly.", "7. Implement the forgot password functionality. This will involve creating a new route in the Flask application that handles POST requests to '/forgot-password'. This route will accept JSON data containing the user's email. It will retrieve the user from the database using the email, generate a secure token using the itsdangerous library, and send an email to the user with a link to reset their password. The link will contain the secure token as a query parameter. Write tests to ensure that the forgot password functionality is working correctly.", "8. Implement the reset password functionality. This will involve creating a new route in the Flask application that handles POST requests to '/reset-password'. This route will accept JSON data containing the secure token and the new password. It will verify the secure token using the itsdangerous library, retrieve the user from the database using the id stored in the token, set the new password using the set_password method, and save the user to the database. It will then return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the reset password functionality is working correctly.", "9. Implement the file upload functionality. This will involve creating a new route in the Flask application that handles POST requests to '/upload'. This route will accept a file and JSON data containing the file's name, size, type, and the user's id. It will create a new File object, save the file to the file system, and save the File object to the database. It will then return a success message and the file's id. Write tests to ensure that the file upload functionality is working correctly.", "10. Implement the file download functionality. This will involve creating a new route in the Flask application that handles GET requests to '/download'. This route will accept a query parameter containing the file's id. It will retrieve the File object from the database using the id, retrieve the file from the file system using the File object's path, and return the file. Write tests to ensure that the file download functionality is working correctly.", "11. Implement the file organization functionality. This will involve creating new routes in the Flask application that handle POST requests to '/create-folder', '/rename', '/move', and '/delete'. The '/create-folder' route will accept JSON data containing the folder's name and the user's id, create a new Folder object, and save it to the database. The '/rename' route will accept JSON data containing the file's or folder's id and the new name, retrieve the File or Folder object from the database using the id, update the name, and save it to the database. The '/move' route will accept JSON data containing the file's or folder's id and the new path, retrieve the File or Folder object from the database using the id, update the path, and save it to the database. The '/delete' route will accept JSON data containing the file's or folder's id, retrieve the File or Folder object from the database using the id, delete the file or folder from the file system, and delete the File or Folder object from the database. Write tests to ensure that the file organization functionality is working correctly.", "12. Implement the file versioning functionality. This will involve modifying the File model to include a versions field, which will be a list of File objects representing previous versions of the file. The file upload functionality will be modified to create a new File object for each version of a file, add the new File object to the versions list of the original File object, and save the original File object to the database. The file download functionality will be modified to accept an optional query parameter containing the version number, retrieve the corresponding File object from the versions list, and return the file. Write tests to ensure that the file versioning functionality is working correctly.", "13. Implement the file sharing functionality. This will involve creating new routes in the Flask application that handle POST requests to '/share-link' and '/share-folder'. The '/share-link' route will accept JSON data containing the file's id, an optional expiry date, and an optional password. It will generate a shareable URL link for the file, which will include the file's id, the expiry date, and the password as query parameters. The '/share-folder' route will accept JSON data containing the folder's id, the email of the user to share with, and the permissions. It will retrieve the Folder object from the database using the id, add the user to the Folder object's shared_with list with the specified permissions, and save the Folder object to the database. Write tests to ensure that the file sharing functionality is working correctly.", "14. Implement the activity log functionality. This will involve creating a new Activity model, which will represent an activity in the system. It will have fields for id, user_id, action, and timestamp. The id will be a unique identifier for the activity. The user_id will be a foreign key referencing the User model, indicating the user who performed the activity. The action will be a string describing the activity. The timestamp will be the time when the activity was performed. Each route in the Flask application will be modified to create a new Activity object after performing its action, and save the Activity object to the database. Write tests to ensure that the activity log functionality is working correctly.", "15. Implement the user profile functionality. This will involve creating a new route in the Flask application that handles GET requests to '/profile'. This route will accept a query parameter containing the user's id. It will retrieve the User object from the database using the id, and return the User object's name, email, profile picture, and storage used. Write tests to ensure that the user profile functionality is working correctly.", "16. Finally, implement the UI/UX requirements. This will involve creating a new route in the Flask application that handles GET requests to '/'. This route will return a HTML file containing the user interface of the application. The user interface will be responsive, with different views for web, mobile, and tablet. It will have a light and dark mode, which can be toggled by the user. It will have a file preview feature, which will display thumbnails for images and videos, and document viewers for common file types. Write tests to ensure that the user interface is working correctly."], "step": "16. Finally, implement the UI/UX requirements.
