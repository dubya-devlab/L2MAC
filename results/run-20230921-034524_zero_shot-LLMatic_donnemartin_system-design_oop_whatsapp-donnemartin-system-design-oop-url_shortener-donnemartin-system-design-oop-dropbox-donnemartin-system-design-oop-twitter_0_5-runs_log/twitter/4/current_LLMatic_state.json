For example, the User model should have fields for username, password, and a list of followers. The Tweet model should have fields for the content of the tweet, the user who posted it, and privacy settings. The Conversation model should group tweets that are replies to each other. The DirectMessage model should represent private messages between users. The TrendingTweet model should represent tweets that are currently popular.\",\n    \"Step 2: Implement the controllers for each model. These controllers should provide methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting instances of each model. For example, the UserController should provide methods for creating a new user, getting a user by their username, updating a user's password, and deleting a user. The TweetController should provide methods for creating a new tweet, getting a tweet by its ID, updating a tweet's content, and deleting a tweet.\",\n    \"Step 3: Implement the views for each model. These views should provide a user interface for interacting with the controllers. For example, the UserView should provide a form for creating a new user, a list view for displaying all users, and a detail view for displaying a single user. The TweetView should provide a form for creating a new tweet, a list view for displaying all tweets, and a detail view for displaying a single tweet.\",\n    \"Step 4: Implement the privacy controls for tweets.

This should be done in the TrendingTweetController and the TrendingTweetView. The controller should provide a method for getting the currently trending tweets, and the view should provide a user interface for displaying these tweets.\",\n    \"Step 7: Implement the functionality for direct messaging. This should be done in the DirectMessageController and the DirectMessageView. The controller should provide methods for sending and receiving direct messages, and the view should provide a user interface for using these methods.\",\n    \"Step 8: Implement the functionality for mentioning and tagging users.

The controller should provide a method for mentioning a user in a tweet, and the view should provide a user interface for using this method.\",\n    \"Step 9: Implement the functionality for following users.
