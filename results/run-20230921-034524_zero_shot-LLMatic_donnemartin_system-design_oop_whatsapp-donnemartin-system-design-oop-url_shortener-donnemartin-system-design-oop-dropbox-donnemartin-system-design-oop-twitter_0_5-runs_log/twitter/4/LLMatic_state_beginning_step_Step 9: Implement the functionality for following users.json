You always indent code with tabs.\n\nWhen modifying code and including new code, you must use the diff format using the line numbers.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nIf you are unsure, you can list all available files to view with the `list_files` function.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou can write to local files, however you cannot use any databases, as none are setup in the local environment.\n\nUse the functions provided.

Design Twitter.\nFeatures to implement:\n1. Privacy controls around each tweet.\n2. Users should be able to post tweets also the system should support replies to tweets/grouping tweets by conversations.\n3. Users should be able to see trending tweets/posts.\n4. Direct messaging\n5. Mentions/Tagging.\n6. The user should be able to follow another user.\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating a detailed step-by-step plan. Try to solve the problem in the minimal steps necessary, in no more than 10 steps. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. The last step should be running any tests automatically if they exist, and the penultimate step writing these tests. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "provide_detailed_sub_task_steps_for_sub_agents", "arguments": "{\n  \"steps\": [\n    \"Step 1: Define the data models for the system. This includes User, Tweet, Conversation, DirectMessage, and TrendingTweet. Each model should have appropriate fields to represent the data it is supposed to hold. For example, the User model should have fields for username, password, and a list of followers. The Tweet model should have fields for the content of the tweet, the user who posted it, and privacy settings. The Conversation model should group tweets that are replies to each other. The DirectMessage model should represent private messages between users. The TrendingTweet model should represent tweets that are currently popular.\",\n    \"Step 2: Implement the controllers for each model. These controllers should provide methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting instances of each model. For example, the UserController should provide methods for creating a new user, getting a user by their username, updating a user's password, and deleting a user. The TweetController should provide methods for creating a new tweet, getting a tweet by its ID, updating a tweet's content, and deleting a tweet.\",\n    \"Step 3: Implement the views for each model. These views should provide a user interface for interacting with the controllers. For example, the UserView should provide a form for creating a new user, a list view for displaying all users, and a detail view for displaying a single user. The TweetView should provide a form for creating a new tweet, a list view for displaying all tweets, and a detail view for displaying a single tweet.\",\n    \"Step 4: Implement the privacy controls for tweets. This should be done in the TweetController and the TweetView. The controller should provide a method for setting the privacy settings of a tweet, and the view should provide a user interface for using this method.\",\n    \"Step 5: Implement the functionality for replying to tweets and grouping tweets by conversation. This should be done in the TweetController and the ConversationController. The TweetController should provide a method for creating a reply to a tweet, and the ConversationController should provide a method for grouping tweets into a conversation.\",\n    \"Step 6: Implement the functionality for viewing trending tweets. This should be done in the TrendingTweetController and the TrendingTweetView. The controller should provide a method for getting the currently trending tweets, and the view should provide a user interface for displaying these tweets.\",\n    \"Step 7: Implement the functionality for direct messaging. This should be done in the DirectMessageController and the DirectMessageView. The controller should provide methods for sending and receiving direct messages, and the view should provide a user interface for using these methods.\",\n    \"Step 8: Implement the functionality for mentioning and tagging users. This should be done in the TweetController and the UserView. The controller should provide a method for mentioning a user in a tweet, and the view should provide a user interface for using this method.\",\n    \"Step 9: Implement the functionality for following users. This should be done in the UserController and the UserView. The controller should provide a method for following a user, and the view should provide a user interface for using this method.\",\n    \"Step 10: Write tests for all the implemented functionality.
