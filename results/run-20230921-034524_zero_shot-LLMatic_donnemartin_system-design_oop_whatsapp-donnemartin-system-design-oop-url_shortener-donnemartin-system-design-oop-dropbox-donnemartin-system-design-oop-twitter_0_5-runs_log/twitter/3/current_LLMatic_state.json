Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. The last step should be running any tests automatically if they exist, and the penultimate step writing these tests. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "provide_detailed_sub_task_steps_for_sub_agents", "arguments": "{\n  \"steps\": [\n    \"Step 1: Define the core classes and their methods for the MVC architecture.

The Tweet class will have methods for setting privacy controls and grouping tweets by conversations. The Conversation class will have methods for grouping tweets into a conversation. The DirectMessage class will have methods for sending and receiving direct messages.
