This class should have methods for uploading, viewing, searching, sharing, and downloading files. It should also have properties for user information like username, password, and a list of files owned by the user.\",\n    \"Step 3: Write the code for the File class. This class should have properties for file information like file name, file size, file type, and file content. It should also have methods for reading and writing file content.\",\n    \"Step 4: Write the code for the Permission class. This class should have properties for permission information like read permission, write permission, and share permission. It should also have methods for checking and setting permissions.\",\n    \"Step 5: Write the code for the Database class. This class should have methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database. It should also have methods for handling transactions to ensure ACID properties.\",\n    \"Step 6: Write the code for the main function. This function should create instances of the User, File, Permission, and Database classes and call their methods to perform the required operations.\",\n    \"Step 7: Write the code for the tests. These tests should check the functionality of the User, File, Permission, and Database classes and their methods.\",\n    \"Step 8: Run the tests and check the output. If there are any errors, go back to the relevant step and correct the code.\",\n    \"Step 9: Once all tests pass, finalize the code and write the final version of the system.\",\n    \"Step 10: Run the final version of the system and check its functionality. If there are any errors, go back to the relevant step and correct the code.\"\n  ]\n}"}, "content": null}]}
