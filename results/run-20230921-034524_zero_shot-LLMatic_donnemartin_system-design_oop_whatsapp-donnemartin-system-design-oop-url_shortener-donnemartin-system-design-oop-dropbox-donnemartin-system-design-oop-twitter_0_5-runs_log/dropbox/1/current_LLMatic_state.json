Ability to upload / view / search / share / download files.\n2. ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties should be present in the system.\n3. Approach to track permission for file sharing.\n4. Allowing multiple users to edit the same document.\n5. The system should support storing large files up to a GB.\n```\n\nUnderstand the problem, by creating a detailed step-by-step plan. Try to solve the problem in the minimal steps necessary, in no more than 10 steps. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. The last step should be running any tests automatically if they exist, and the penultimate step writing these tests. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "function_call": {"name": "provide_detailed_sub_task_steps_for_sub_agents", "arguments": "{\n  \"steps\": [\n    \"Step 1: Identify the core components of the system.

The File class will handle file-related operations such as upload, download, view, and delete. The Sharing class will handle file sharing operations such as share and unshare. Each class will have its own methods to perform these operations.\",\n    \"Step 2: Design the User class. This class will have methods for user registration, login, and logout. It will also have a method to get the user's files. The User class will have attributes such as username, password, and a list of files.\",\n    \"Step 3: Design the File class. This class will have methods for file upload, download, view, and delete. It will also have a method to get the file's metadata. The File class will have attributes such as file name, file size, file type, and file content.\",\n    \"Step 4: Design the Sharing class. This class will have methods for file sharing and unsharing. It will also have a method to get the shared files. The Sharing class will have attributes such as the file to be shared, the user who shared the file, and the users with whom the file is shared.\",\n    \"Step 5: Implement the ACID properties in the system. This can be achieved by using a database management system that supports ACID properties. The system will need to handle transactions to ensure that the ACID properties are maintained.\",\n    \"Step 6: Implement the approach to track permission for file sharing. This can be achieved by adding a permissions attribute to the File class. The permissions attribute will be a list of users who have permission to view and edit the file.\",\n    \"Step 7: Implement the feature to allow multiple users to edit the same document. This can be achieved by using a version control system. The system will need to handle conflicts when multiple users try to edit the same document at the same time.\",\n    \"Step 8: Implement the feature to support storing large files up to a GB. This can be achieved by using a file system that supports large files. The system will need to handle file splitting and merging for large files.\",\n    \"Step 9: Write tests for each class and method. The tests should cover all the features of the system.
