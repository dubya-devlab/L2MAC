Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new directory for the project and initialize it as a Python project. Create a `requirements.txt` file to manage the project dependencies. The project will require Flask for the web server, pytest for testing, and dataclasses for data management. Write the `requirements.txt` file with these dependencies and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them. Create a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and all dependencies are installed.", "2. Create the User Registration and Authentication system. This will involve creating a User class with attributes for email and password, and methods for signing up and password recovery. The sign up method should take an email and password, check that the email is not already in use, and then add the user to the system. The password recovery method should take an email, check that it is in the system, and then return the associated password. Create a mock database using a dictionary to store users for now. Write tests to ensure that the User class and its methods work correctly.", "3. Implement the User Profile feature. This will involve adding attributes for profile picture and status message to the User class, and methods for setting these attributes. The privacy settings can be implemented as a dictionary attribute, with keys for 'details' and 'last seen' and values of 'everyone', 'contacts', or 'nobody'. Write tests to ensure that the User Profile feature works correctly.", "4. Implement the Contact Management feature. This will involve creating a Contact class with attributes for blocked status and group membership, and methods for blocking/unblocking and managing groups. The group management methods should allow for creating, editing, and deleting groups. Write tests to ensure that the Contact Management feature works correctly.", "5. Implement the Messaging feature. This will involve creating a Message class with attributes for sender, receiver, content, read receipt, encryption status, and type (text, image, emoji, GIF, sticker). The Message class should also have methods for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting and decrypting messages, and handling different types of content. Write tests to ensure that the Messaging feature works correctly.", "6. Implement the Group Chats feature. This will involve adding attributes for group chats to the User and Contact classes, and methods for creating group chats, adding and removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. Write tests to ensure that the Group Chats feature works correctly.", "7. Implement the Status/Story Feature. This will involve adding an attribute for status to the User class, and methods for posting and viewing statuses. The status attribute should be a list of images, and the methods should handle adding images to the list, removing them after a certain time, and controlling who can see them. Write tests to ensure that the Status/Story Feature works correctly.", "8. Implement the Web Application feature. This will involve setting up a Flask server and creating routes for the different features. The routes should handle user registration and authentication, user profile management, contact management, messaging, group chats, and statuses. Write tests to ensure that the Web Application feature works correctly.", "9. Implement the Connectivity and Offline Mode feature. This will involve adding an attribute for online status to the User class, and methods for updating the online status and queuing messages when offline. The Message class should also have a method for sending queued messages when the user comes back online. Write tests to ensure that the Connectivity and Offline Mode feature works correctly.", "10. Finally, review the entire project to ensure that all features have been implemented correctly and all tests pass. Make any necessary adjustments and run all tests again to confirm. The Global Chat Service should now be fully functional."], "step": "3. Implement the User Profile feature.

Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
