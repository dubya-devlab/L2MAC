Create a Flask application with the necessary routes for the URL shortening service. The routes should include '/shorten' for shortening URLs, '/' for redirecting shortened URLs to their original URLs, '/analytics' for viewing URL analytics, '/account' for user account related operations, and '/admin' for admin dashboard. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store the data. The data to be stored includes user accounts, shortened URLs, and analytics data. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the routes are working as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Users should be able to input a URL to be shortened. The system should validate that the URL is active and legitimate. If the URL is valid, the system should generate a unique shortened URL. Users should also have the option to choose custom short links, subject to availability. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature is working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. Accessing the shortened URL should redirect to the original URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the redirection feature is working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Users should be able to view statistics about their shortened URLs. The statistics should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the analytics feature is working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Users should be able to create accounts. Account holders should be able to view all their shortened URLs. Account holders should also be able to edit or delete their shortened URLs. Account holders should also be able to view analytics for all their shortened URLs. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the user accounts feature is working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Administrators should be able to view all shortened URLs. Administrators should also be able to delete any URL or user account. Administrators should also be able to monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature is working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the expiration feature. Users should be able to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. After the expiration date/time, the shortened URL should no longer redirect to the original URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the expiration feature is working correctly.", "Step 8: After implementing all the features, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire system. This includes testing all the routes, all the features, and the mock database. Ensure that all the tests pass.", "Step 9: After testing, perform code review and refactoring. Ensure that the code follows best practices for Python and Flask. Also, ensure that the code is clean, efficient, and well-documented.", "Step 10: Finally, package the project for deployment. This includes creating a requirements.txt file with all the necessary dependencies, and setting up the project for deployment on a platform like Heroku or AWS.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
