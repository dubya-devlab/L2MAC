Write tests to ensure that the posting and content management functions work as expected.", "5. **Implement Interacting with Posts:** Implement the feature to interact with posts. This involves creating a Comment dataclass with fields for the comment content and the user who created the comment, and adding a field to the Post dataclass for storing comments. Implement a function to like, retweet, and reply to posts. The function should take a User instance, a Post instance, and the action (like, retweet, or reply) as input, update the Post instance accordingly, and return the updated Post. Write tests to ensure that the interacting with posts function works as expected.", "6. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves implementing a function to search for posts or users. The function should take a keyword as input, search the mock database for posts or users that match the keyword, and return the matching posts or users. Implement a function to filter posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. The function should take a filter type (hashtag, mention, or trending topic) and a value as input, search the mock database for posts that match the filter, and return the matching posts. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search functions work as expected.", "7. **Implement Following & Followers:** Implement the following and followers feature. This involves adding a field to the User dataclass for storing the users that the user is following, and a function to follow and unfollow users.

Implement a function to display a timeline view of posts from followed users. The function should take a User instance as input, retrieve the posts from the users that the user is following, and return the posts. Write tests to ensure that the following and followers functions work as expected.", "8. **Implement Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for the message content, the sender, and the receiver, and a function to send messages. The function should take two User instances (the sender and the receiver) and the message content as input, create a new Message instance, and store it in an in-memory dictionary that acts as a mock database. Implement a function to block and unblock users from messaging. The function should take two User instances (the blocker and the blockee) as input, update the blocker's blocked list accordingly, and return the updated User. Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging functions work as expected.", "9. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for the notification content and the user who will receive the notification, and a function to create notifications. The function should take a User instance and the notification content as input, create a new Notification instance, and store it in an in-memory dictionary that acts as a mock database. Implement a function to retrieve notifications for a user. The function should take a User instance as input, retrieve the notifications for the user, and return the notifications. Write tests to ensure that the notifications functions work as expected.", "10. **Implement Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending and discovery feature. This involves implementing a function to identify and display trending hashtags or topics. The function should analyze the posts in the mock database, identify the trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions, and return the trending hashtags or topics. Implement a function to recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. The function should analyze the users in the mock database, identify the users to recommend based on the criteria, and return the recommended users. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery functions work as expected."], "step": "8. **Implement Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
