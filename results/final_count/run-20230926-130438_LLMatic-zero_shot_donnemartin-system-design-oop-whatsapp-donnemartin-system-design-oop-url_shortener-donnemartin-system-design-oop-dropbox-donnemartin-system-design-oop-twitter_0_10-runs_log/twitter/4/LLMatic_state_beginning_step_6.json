Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and the application runs without errors.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password, and a function to register new users. The function should take the user's email, username, and password as input, create a new User instance, and store it in an in-memory dictionary that acts as a mock database. The function should also handle cases where the email or username is already taken. For authentication, implement a function that takes a username and password, verifies them against the stored User instances, and returns a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication functions work as expected.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile information (profile picture, bio, website link, and location), and a boolean field for whether the profile is private or public. Implement a function to edit the profile information. The function should take a User instance and the new profile information as input, update the User instance, and return the updated User. Write tests to ensure that the profile management function works as expected.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature.

The function should take a User instance and the post content and images as input, create a new Post instance, and store it in an in-memory dictionary that acts as a mock database. Implement a function to delete posts. The function should take a User instance and a Post instance as input, verify that the User is the creator of the Post, and remove the Post from the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content management functions work as expected.", "5. **Implement Interacting with Posts:** Implement the feature to interact with posts. This involves creating a Comment dataclass with fields for the comment content and the user who created the comment, and adding a field to the Post dataclass for storing comments. Implement a function to like, retweet, and reply to posts. The function should take a User instance, a Post instance, and the action (like, retweet, or reply) as input, update the Post instance accordingly, and return the updated Post. Write tests to ensure that the interacting with posts function works as expected.", "6. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves implementing a function to search for posts or users. The function should take a keyword as input, search the mock database for posts or users that match the keyword, and return the matching posts or users. Implement a function to filter posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. The function should take a filter type (hashtag, mention, or trending topic) and a value as input, search the mock database for posts that match the filter, and return the matching posts. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search functions work as expected.", "7. **Implement Following & Followers:** Implement the following and followers feature. This involves adding a field to the User dataclass for storing the users that the user is following, and a function to follow and unfollow users. The function should take two User instances (the follower and the followee) as input, update the follower's following list accordingly, and return the updated User. Implement a function to display a timeline view of posts from followed users. The function should take a User instance as input, retrieve the posts from the users that the user is following, and return the posts. Write tests to ensure that the following and followers functions work as expected.", "8. **Implement Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for the message content, the sender, and the receiver, and a function to send messages. The function should take two User instances (the sender and the receiver) and the message content as input, create a new Message instance, and store it in an in-memory dictionary that acts as a mock database. Implement a function to block and unblock users from messaging. The function should take two User instances (the blocker and the blockee) as input, update the blocker's blocked list accordingly, and return the updated User. Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging functions work as expected.", "9. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for the notification content and the user who will receive the notification, and a function to create notifications. The function should take a User instance and the notification content as input, create a new Notification instance, and store it in an in-memory dictionary that acts as a mock database. Implement a function to retrieve notifications for a user. The function should take a User instance as input, retrieve the notifications for the user, and return the notifications. Write tests to ensure that the notifications functions work as expected.", "10. **Implement Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending and discovery feature. This involves implementing a function to identify and display trending hashtags or topics. The function should analyze the posts in the mock database, identify the trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions, and return the trending hashtags or topics. Implement a function to recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. The function should analyze the users in the mock database, identify the users to recommend based on the criteria, and return the recommended users. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery functions work as expected."], "step": "7. **Implement Following & Followers:** Implement the following and followers feature. This involves adding a field to the User dataclass for storing the users that the user is following, and a function to follow and unfollow users.
