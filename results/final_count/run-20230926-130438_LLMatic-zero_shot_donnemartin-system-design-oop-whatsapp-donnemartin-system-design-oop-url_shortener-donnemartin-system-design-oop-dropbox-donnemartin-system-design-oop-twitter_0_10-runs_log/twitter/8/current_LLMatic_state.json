Write a test to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and that the necessary files exist.", "Step 2: Implement the User Management functionality. This will involve creating a User class with attributes for email, username, password, profile picture, bio, website link, and location. The User class should also have methods for registering a new user, resetting a forgotten password, and editing profile information. The password should be hashed for security purposes. Create a 'user.py' file to house the User class. Write tests to ensure that the User class is functioning as expected.", "Step 3: Implement JWT authentication. This will involve creating a function to generate a JWT token when a user logs in, and another function to decode the JWT token to authenticate requests. These functions should be placed in a 'auth.py' file. Write tests to ensure that the JWT authentication is functioning as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the Posting & Content Management functionality. This will involve creating a Post class with attributes for the post text, images, and the user who created the post. The Post class should also have methods for creating a new post, deleting a post, and liking, retweeting, and replying to a post. Create a 'post.py' file to house the Post class. Write tests to ensure that the Post class is functioning as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the Content Filtering & Search functionality.

These functions should be placed in a 'search.py' file. Write tests to ensure that the search and filter functions are functioning as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the Social Interaction functionality. This will involve adding methods to the User class for following and unfollowing other users, and receiving notifications for new followers. Also, create a Message class for handling direct messages between users. The Message class should have attributes for the sender, recipient, and message text, and methods for sending a new message and blocking/unblocking users. Create a 'message.py' file to house the Message class. Write tests to ensure that the social interaction functionality is functioning as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the Notifications functionality. This will involve creating a Notification class with attributes for the user who will receive the notification and the event that triggered the notification. The Notification class should also have a method for sending a notification. Create a 'notification.py' file to house the Notification class. Write tests to ensure that the Notification class is functioning as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the Trending & Discovery functionality. This will involve creating functions to identify and display trending hashtags or topics, and to recommend users to follow. These functions should be placed in a 'trending.py' file. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery functions are functioning as expected.", "Step 9: Integrate all the components of the application in the 'app.py' file.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
