Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and the application runs without errors.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password, and a function to register new users. The function should take the user's email, username, and password as input, create a new User instance, and store it in an in-memory dictionary that acts as a mock database. The function should also handle cases where the email or username is already taken. For authentication, implement a function that takes a username and password, verifies them against the stored User data, and returns a JWT token if the credentials are correct. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication functions work as expected.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile information (profile picture, bio, website link, and location), and a boolean field for whether the profile is private or public. Implement a function to edit the profile information. The function should take a User instance and the new profile information as input, update the User instance, and store it back in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the profile management function works as expected.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass with fields for the post content, images, and the user who created the post. Implement a function to create new posts. The function should take a User instance and the post content and images as input, create a new Post instance, and store it in a separate in-memory dictionary that acts as a mock database for posts. Implement a function to delete posts. The function should take a User instance and a Post instance as input, verify that the user is the creator of the post, and remove the post from the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the posting functions work as expected.", "5. **Implement Interacting with Posts:** Implement the feature to interact with posts. This involves creating a Comment dataclass with fields for the comment content and the user who created the comment, and adding fields to the Post dataclass for likes, retweets, and comments. Implement functions to like, retweet, and comment on posts. The functions should take a User instance and a Post instance as input, update the corresponding field in the Post instance, and store it back in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the interaction functions work as expected.", "6. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves implementing a function to search for posts or users. The function should take a keyword as input, search the mock databases for posts and users that match the keyword, and return the results. Implement a function to filter posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. The function should take a filter type and value as input, search the mock database for posts that match the filter, and return the results. Write tests to ensure that the search and filter functions work as expected.", "7. **Implement Following & Followers:** Implement the following and followers feature. This involves adding fields to the User dataclass for following and followers, and implementing functions to follow and unfollow users. The functions should take two User instances as input, update the following and followers fields of the respective users, and store them back in the mock database. Implement a function to display a timeline view of posts from followed users. The function should take a User instance as input, retrieve the posts from the users that the user is following, and return them. Write tests to ensure that the following functions work as expected.", "8. **Implement Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for the message content, sender, and receiver, and implementing a function to send messages. The function should take two User instances and the message content as input, create a new Message instance, and store it in a separate in-memory dictionary that acts as a mock database for messages. Implement a function to block and unblock users from messaging. The function should take two User instances as input, update a blocked users field in the User instance, and store it back in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the messaging functions work as expected.", "9. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves adding a field to the User dataclass for notifications, and implementing functions to add notifications when a user's post is liked, retweeted, replied to, or when the user is mentioned. The functions should take a User instance and a notification content as input, update the notifications field in the User instance, and store it back in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the notification functions work as expected.", "10. **Implement Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending and discovery feature. This involves implementing a function to identify and display trending hashtags or topics. The function should analyze the posts in the mock database, calculate the volume and velocity of mentions for each hashtag or topic, and return the top trending ones. Implement a function to recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. The function should analyze the users and posts in the mock databases, calculate a recommendation score for each user, and return the top recommended users. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery functions work as expected."], "step": "9. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature.

You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}], "message_hash": "7de03066b7197cdd53a97801ccb7e89208dba9e1a753c674fbcb9d0bfdc4d878"}
