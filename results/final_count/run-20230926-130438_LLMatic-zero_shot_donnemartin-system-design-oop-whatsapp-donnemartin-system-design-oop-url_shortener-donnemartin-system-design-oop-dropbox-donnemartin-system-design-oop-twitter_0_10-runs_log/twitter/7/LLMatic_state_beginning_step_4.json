Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly setup and that all dependencies are correctly installed.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass to represent a user, and a mock database (a dictionary) to store users. The User dataclass should include fields for email, username, and password. The registration feature should allow users to register using email, username, and password. The password should be hashed before being stored in the mock database. Also, implement the user authentication feature. This involves creating a login route that accepts a username and password, verifies the credentials against the mock database, and returns a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication features work as expected.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Also, create routes for editing profile information and toggling the profile's privacy setting. Write tests to ensure that the profile management feature works as expected.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass to represent a post, and a mock database (a dictionary) to store posts. The Post dataclass should include fields for the post's text, images, and the username of the user who created the post. The posting feature should allow users to create, view, and delete posts. Also, implement the content interaction feature. This involves creating routes for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content interaction features work as expected.", "5. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves creating a search route that accepts a keyword and returns all posts that contain the keyword. Also, create a filter route that accepts a hashtag, user mention, or trending topic and returns all posts that contain the filter. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search feature works as expected.", "6. **Implement Social Interaction:** Implement the social interaction feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for followers and following. Also, create routes for following/unfollowing users, viewing a timeline of posts from followed users, and receiving notifications for new followers. Write tests to ensure that the social interaction feature works as expected.", "7. **Implement Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass to represent a message, and a mock database (a dictionary) to store messages. The Message dataclass should include fields for the message's text and the usernames of the sender and receiver. The direct messaging feature should allow users to send, view, and delete messages. Also, create routes for blocking/unblocking users from messaging. Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging feature works as expected.", "8. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass to represent a notification, and a mock database (a dictionary) to store notifications. The Notification dataclass should include fields for the notification's text and the username of the user who should receive the notification. The notifications feature should notify users of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions. Write tests to ensure that the notifications feature works as expected.", "9. **Implement Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending topics feature. This involves creating a TrendingTopic dataclass to represent a trending topic, and a mock database (a dictionary) to store trending topics. The TrendingTopic dataclass should include fields for the topic's text and the number of mentions. The trending topics feature should identify and display trending topics based on the volume and velocity of mentions. Also, implement the user recommendations feature. This involves creating a route that recommends users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery features work as expected.", "10. **Final Testing and Refactoring:** After implementing all features, perform a final round of testing to ensure that all features work together as expected. This involves running all tests and fixing any issues that arise. Also, refactor the code to improve its structure and readability. Finally, write tests to ensure that the final product works as expected."], "step": "5. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves creating a search route that accepts a keyword and returns all posts that contain the keyword.
