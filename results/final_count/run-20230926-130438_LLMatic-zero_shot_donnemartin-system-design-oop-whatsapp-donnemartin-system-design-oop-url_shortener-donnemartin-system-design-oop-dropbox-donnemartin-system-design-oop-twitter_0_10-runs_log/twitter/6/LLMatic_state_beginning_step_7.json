["1. **Setup the project structure and environment:** Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly setup and that all dependencies are correctly installed.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass to represent a user, and a mock database (a dictionary) to store users. The User dataclass should include fields for email, username, and password. The registration feature should allow users to register using email, username, and password. The password should be hashed before being stored in the database. Also, implement the user authentication feature. This involves creating a login route that accepts a username and password, verifies the credentials against the database, and returns a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication features work as expected.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Also, create a route for editing profile information. The route should accept a JWT token for authentication, and update the user's profile information in the database. Write tests to ensure that the profile management feature works as expected.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass to represent a post, and updating the mock database to store posts. The Post dataclass should include fields for the post text, images, and the username of the user who created the post. Also, create a route for creating posts. The route should accept a JWT token for authentication, and create a new post in the database. Implement the post deletion feature by creating a route that accepts a JWT token and a post ID, and deletes the corresponding post from the database. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content management features work as expected.", "5. **Implement Interacting with Posts:** Implement the feature for interacting with posts. This involves creating a Comment dataclass to represent a comment, and updating the mock database to store comments. The Comment dataclass should include fields for the comment text and the username of the user who created the comment. Also, create routes for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts. These routes should accept a JWT token for authentication, and update the corresponding post or comment in the database. Write tests to ensure that the interacting with posts feature works as expected.", "6. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves creating a route that accepts a search query and returns posts or users that match the query. The search feature should support searching for specific posts or users using keywords, and filtering based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search feature works as expected.", "7. **Implement Following & Followers:** Implement the following and followers feature. This involves updating the User dataclass to include fields for following and followers, and creating routes for following and unfollowing users. The routes should accept a JWT token for authentication, and update the corresponding user's following and followers in the database. Also, create a route for displaying a timeline view of posts from followed users. Write tests to ensure that the following and followers feature works as expected.", "8. **Implement Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass to represent a message, and updating the mock database to store messages. The Message dataclass should include fields for the message text, the sender's username, and the recipient's username. Also, create routes for sending and receiving messages. These routes should accept a JWT token for authentication, and update the corresponding messages in the database. Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging feature works as expected.", "9. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass to represent a notification, and updating the mock database to store notifications. The Notification dataclass should include fields for the notification text and the username of the user who should receive the notification. Also, create a route for retrieving notifications. This route should accept a JWT token for authentication, and return the corresponding user's notifications from the database. Write tests to ensure that the notifications feature works as expected.", "10. **Implement Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending and discovery feature. This involves creating a route that identifies and displays trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. The trending topics should be sortable based on location or globally. Also, create a route for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery feature works as expected."], "step": "8. **Implement Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
