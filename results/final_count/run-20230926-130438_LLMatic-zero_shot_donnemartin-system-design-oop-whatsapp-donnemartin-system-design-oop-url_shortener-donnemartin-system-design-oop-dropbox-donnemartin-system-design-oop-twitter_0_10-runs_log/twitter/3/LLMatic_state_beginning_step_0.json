Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly setup and that all dependencies are installed. Run these tests using pytest.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store user data. Implement the registration route (/register) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with user data (email, username, password), create a new User object, and store it in the mock database. For authentication, implement the login route (/login). This route should accept POST requests with username and password, verify these credentials against the mock database, and return a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests for the registration and login routes, and run these tests using pytest.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile information (profile picture, bio, website link, location, and profile visibility). Also, implement the profile route (/profile) in the Flask application. This route should accept GET requests to retrieve a user's profile information, and PUT requests to update a user's profile information. Write tests for the profile route, and run these tests using pytest.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass with fields for post content, post images, and post author. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store post data. Implement the post route (/post) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with post data (content, images), create a new Post object, and store it in the mock database. For content management, implement the delete post route (/delete_post). This route should accept DELETE requests with a post ID, and remove the corresponding post from the mock database. Write tests for the post and delete post routes, and run these tests using pytest.", "5. **Implement Interacting with Posts:** Implement the feature for interacting with posts. This involves creating a Comment dataclass with fields for comment content and comment author. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store comment data. Implement the comment route (/comment) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with comment data (content), create a new Comment object, and store it in the mock database. Also, implement the like and retweet routes (/like, /retweet). These routes should accept POST requests with a post ID, and update the corresponding post in the mock database. Write tests for the comment, like, and retweet routes, and run these tests using pytest.", "6. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves adding a search route (/search) in the Flask application. This route should accept GET requests with a search query, and return posts and users from the mock databases that match the search query. For content filtering, implement the filter route (/filter). This route should accept GET requests with a filter type (hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics), and return posts from the mock database that match the filter type. Write tests for the search and filter routes, and run these tests using pytest.", "7. **Implement Following & Followers:** Implement the following and followers feature. This involves adding fields to the User dataclass for following and followers. Also, implement the follow and unfollow routes (/follow, /unfollow) in the Flask application. These routes should accept POST requests with a user ID, and update the following and followers fields of the corresponding users in the mock database. For the timeline view, implement the timeline route (/timeline). This route should accept GET requests with a user ID, and return posts from the followed users in the mock database. Write tests for the follow, unfollow, and timeline routes, and run these tests using pytest.", "8. **Implement Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for message content, sender, and receiver. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store message data. Implement the message route (/message) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with message data (content, sender, receiver), create a new Message object, and store it in the mock database. For blocking users, add a blocked users field to the User dataclass, and update the message route to check this field before storing a new Message object. Write tests for the message route, and run these tests using pytest.", "9. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for notification type (likes, retweets, replies, mentions), user, and post. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store notification data. Implement the notification route (/notification) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with notification data (type, user, post), create a new Notification object, and store it in the mock database. Write tests for the notification route, and run these tests using pytest.", "10. **Implement Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending topics feature. This involves adding a trending topics route (/trending) in the Flask application. This route should accept GET requests, and return trending topics based on the posts in the mock database. For user recommendations, implement the recommend route (/recommend). This route should accept GET requests with a user ID, and return recommended users based on the interests, activity, and mutual followers of the user in the mock database. Write tests for the trending and recommend routes, and run these tests using pytest."], "step": "1. **Setup the project structure and environment:** Start by setting up the project structure.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
