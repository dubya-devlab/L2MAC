Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.

This involves creating a Comment dataclass with fields for comment content and comment author. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store comment data. Implement the comment route (/comment) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with comment data (content), create a new Comment object, and store it in the mock database. Also, implement the like and retweet routes (/like, /retweet). These routes should accept POST requests with a post ID, and update the corresponding post in the mock database. Write tests for the comment, like, and retweet routes, and run these tests using pytest..\n\n Note: Condition any new code files on the existing code files: ['app.py', 'requirements.txt', 'tests/test_app.py']. Fully implement these features in the code, no placeholders. You can now optionally view the existing files if you need to view them to complete the current task step.
