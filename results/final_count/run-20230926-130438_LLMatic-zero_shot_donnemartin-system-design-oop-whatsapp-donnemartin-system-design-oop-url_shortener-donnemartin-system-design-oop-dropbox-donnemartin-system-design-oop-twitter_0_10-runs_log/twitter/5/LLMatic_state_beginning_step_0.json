This class should have attributes for `email`, `username`, `password`, and `is_private` (for profile privacy). Implement methods for registering a new user (`register`), authenticating a user (`authenticate`), and resetting a user's password (`reset_password`). Use JWT or a similar protocol for secure authentication. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_user.py` to test the `User` class methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Add methods to the `User` class for editing profile information. These methods should allow a user to update their profile picture (`update_profile_picture`), bio (`update_bio`), website link (`update_website_link`), and location (`update_location`). Also, implement a method for toggling the privacy of a user's profile (`toggle_privacy`). After implementing these methods, update the `test_user.py` file to include tests for these new methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "3. **Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Create a `Post` class in a file named `post.py`. This class should have attributes for `user` (the user who created the post), `content` (the text content of the post), `image` (an optional image included in the post), and `timestamp` (the time the post was created). Implement methods for creating a new post (`create`), and deleting a post (`delete`). After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_post.py` to test the `Post` class methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Add methods to the `Post` class for liking a post (`like`), retweeting a post (`retweet`), and replying to a post (`reply`). Implement a nested comment structure for post replies. After implementing these methods, update the `test_post.py` file to include tests for these new methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "5. **Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement a `Search` class in a file named `search.py`. This class should have methods for searching for specific posts or users using keywords (`search_posts`, `search_users`), and filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics (`filter_posts`). After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_search.py` to test the `Search` class methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Add methods to the `User` class for following another user (`follow`), unfollowing a user (`unfollow`), and viewing a timeline of posts from followed users (`view_timeline`). Implement a notification system for new followers. After implementing these methods, update the `test_user.py` file to include tests for these new methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Implement a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have methods for sending a private message to another user (`send`), and blocking/unblocking users from messaging (`block`, `unblock`). After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_message.py` to test the `Message` class methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Add methods to the `User` class for receiving notifications of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions (`receive_notification`). After implementing this method, update the `test_user.py` file to include a test for this new method. Run the test to ensure it passes.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `Trending` class in a file named `trending.py`. This class should have methods for identifying and displaying trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions (`get_trending_topics`), and sorting trending topics based on location or globally (`sort_trending_topics`). After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_trending.py` to test the `Trending` class methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Add a method to the `User` class for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers (`recommend_users`). After implementing this method, update the `test_user.py` file to include a test for this new method. Run the test to ensure it passes."], "step": "1. **User Management - Registration & Authentication:** Start by creating a `User` class in a file named `user.py`.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
