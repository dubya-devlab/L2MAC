The project will be a Flask application, so create an entry point file 'app.py'. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list all the necessary dependencies. The project will need a 'user.py' file for user management, a 'post.py' file for post management, a 'social.py' file for social interactions, and a 'trending.py' file for trending topics and user recommendations. For each of these files, create a corresponding test file with the prefix 'test_'. At this stage, the files will be empty. After setting up the project structure, run a test to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. In the 'user.py' file, create a User class with attributes for email, username, and password. Implement methods for registering a new user and authenticating an existing user. Use JWT for secure authentication. Also, implement a method for resetting forgotten passwords. After implementing these features, write tests in the 'test_user.py' file to ensure that the registration, authentication, and password reset features work correctly. Run these tests and ensure they pass.", "Step 3: Implement the profile management features. In the User class, add attributes for profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Implement methods for editing these profile attributes and for toggling the profile's privacy setting. After implementing these features, write tests in the 'test_user.py' file to ensure that the profile management features work correctly. Run these tests and ensure they pass.", "Step 4: Implement the features for creating and deleting posts.

After implementing these features, write tests in the 'test_post.py' file to ensure that the post interaction features work correctly. Run these tests and ensure they pass.", "Step 6: Implement the content filtering and search features. In the 'post.py' file, implement a method for searching for specific posts or users using keywords. Also, implement a method for filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. After implementing these features, write tests in the 'test_post.py' file to ensure that the content filtering and search features work correctly. Run these tests and ensure they pass.", "Step 7: Implement the features for following and unfollowing users, and for displaying a timeline view. In the 'social.py' file, create a Social class with methods for following a user, unfollowing a user, and displaying a timeline view of posts from followed users. Also, implement a method for notifying users of new followers. After implementing these features, write tests in the 'test_social.py' file to ensure that the following, unfollowing, and timeline view features work correctly.

Run these tests and ensure they pass.", "Step 9: Implement the notification features. In the Social class, add methods for notifying users of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions. After implementing these features, write tests in the 'test_social.py' file to ensure that the notification features work correctly. Run these tests and ensure they pass.", "Step 10: Implement the trending topics and user recommendation features. In the 'trending.py' file, create a Trending class with methods for identifying and displaying trending hashtags or topics, and for recommending users to follow. After implementing these features, write tests in the 'test_trending.py' file to ensure that the trending topics and user recommendation features work correctly.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
