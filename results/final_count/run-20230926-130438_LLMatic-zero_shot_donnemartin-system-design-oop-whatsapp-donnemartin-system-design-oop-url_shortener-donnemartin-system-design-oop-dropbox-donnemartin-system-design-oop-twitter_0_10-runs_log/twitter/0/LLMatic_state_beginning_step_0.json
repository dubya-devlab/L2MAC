Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and the application runs without errors.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store user data. Implement the registration route (/register) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with user data (email, username, password), create a new User object, and store it in the mock database. Implement the authentication feature. This involves creating a login route (/login) that accepts POST requests with username and password, verifies the credentials against the mock database, and returns a JWT token if the credentials are correct. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication features work correctly.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile information (profile picture, bio, website link, location, and privacy setting). Also, create a route (/profile) in the Flask application for managing user profiles. This route should accept GET requests to retrieve profile information and PUT requests to update profile information. The route should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the profile management feature works correctly.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass with fields for post content, images, and author. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store post data. Implement the posting route (/post) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with post data (content, images), create a new Post object, and store it in the mock database. The route should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Implement the content management feature. This involves creating routes for deleting posts (/post/<id>/delete), liking posts (/post/<id>/like), retweeting posts (/post/<id>/retweet), and replying to posts (/post/<id>/reply). These routes should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content management features work correctly.", "5. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves creating a route (/search) in the Flask application that accepts GET requests with search parameters (keywords, hashtags, user mentions, trending topics). The route should return posts that match the search parameters. The route should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search feature works correctly.", "6. **Implement Following & Followers:** Implement the following and followers feature. This involves adding fields to the User dataclass for following and followers (both lists of User objects). Also, create routes in the Flask application for following users (/follow/<username>), unfollowing users (/unfollow/<username>), and viewing the timeline (/timeline). The following and unfollowing routes should update the following and followers lists of the relevant User objects. The timeline route should return posts from followed users. These routes should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the following and followers feature works correctly.", "7. **Implement Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for sender, recipient, and content. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store message data. Implement the messaging route (/message) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with message data (recipient, content), create a new Message object, and store it in the mock database. The route should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging feature works correctly.", "8. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for recipient, type (like, retweet, reply, mention, follow), and related post or user. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store notification data. Implement the notifications route (/notifications) in the Flask application. This route should accept GET requests and return notifications for the authenticated user. The route should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the notifications feature works correctly.", "9. **Implement Trending Topics:** Implement the trending topics feature. This involves creating a function that identifies trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions in posts. Also, create a route (/trending) in the Flask application that returns trending topics. The route should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the trending topics feature works correctly.", "10. **Implement User Recommendations:** Implement the user recommendations feature. This involves creating a function that recommends users to follow based on interests (hashtags in posts), activity (number of posts), and mutual followers. Also, create a route (/recommendations) in the Flask application that returns user recommendations. The route should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the user recommendations feature works correctly."], "step": "1. **Setup the project structure and environment:** Start by setting up the project structure.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
