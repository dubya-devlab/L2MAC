"steps": ["Step 1: Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. The project will be structured as a Flask application, with a main app.py file serving as the entry point. Create a 'models' directory to hold the data models for User and File. In the 'models' directory, create user.py and file.py. Also, create a 'services' directory to hold the business logic for user management, file management, and file sharing. In the 'services' directory, create user_service.py, file_service.py, and share_service.py. Lastly, create a 'tests' directory to hold all the test files. After setting up the project structure, create a requirements.txt file and add Flask, its dependencies, and pytest for testing. Once the project structure is set up, write a test to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up and all necessary files are present.", "Step 2: Implement the User data model in user.py. The User model should have fields for id, name, email, password, profile picture, and storage used. The id will be a unique identifier for each user, the name, email, and password will be used for registration and login, the profile picture will be used in the user profile, and the storage used will keep track of how much storage the user has used. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that the User model is correctly implemented and all fields are present.", "Step 3: Implement the File data model in file.py. The File model should have fields for id, name, type, size, upload date, owner (a reference to the User who uploaded the file), and versions (a list of previous versions of the file). The id will be a unique identifier for each file, the name, type, and size will be used for file management, the upload date will be used for sorting and filtering files, the owner will be used for file sharing and access control, and the versions will be used for file versioning. After implementing the File model, write tests to ensure that the File model is correctly implemented and all fields are present.", "Step 4: Implement user registration in user_service.py. User registration should require a name, email, and password. The email should be unique, and the password should be hashed before being stored. After implementing user registration, write tests to ensure that user registration works correctly, that the email is unique, and that the password is hashed.", "Step 5: Implement user login in user_service.py. User login should require an email and password. The email and password should be checked against the stored values, and if they match, the user should be logged in. If the user forgets their password, they should be able to reset it using their email. After implementing user login, write tests to ensure that user login works correctly, that the email and password are checked correctly, and that password reset works.", "Step 6: Implement file upload in file_service.py. File upload should support drag and drop, and should enforce file size and type restrictions. The file should be stored in a mock database, and the file's details should be stored in the File model. After implementing file upload, write tests to ensure that file upload works correctly, that drag and drop works, and that file size and type restrictions are enforced.", "Step 7: Implement file download in file_service.py. File download should provide a direct download link, and should offer a download folder as ZIP option. After implementing file download, write tests to ensure that file download works correctly, that the direct download link works, and that the download folder as ZIP option works.", "Step 8: Implement file/folder organization in file_service.py. File/folder organization should allow creating folders, and should allow renaming, moving, and deleting files/folders. After implementing file/folder organization, write tests to ensure that file/folder organization works correctly, that folders can be created, and that files/folders can be renamed, moved, and deleted.", "Step 9: Implement file sharing in share_service.py. File sharing should allow generating shareable URL links for files/folders, with expiry date and password protection options. It should also allow inviting users via email to shared folders, with view, edit, and delete permissions. After implementing file sharing, write tests to ensure that file sharing works correctly, that shareable URL links can be generated, that expiry date and password protection options work, and that users can be invited to shared folders with the correct permissions.", "Step 10: Implement security features in user_service.py and file_service.py. Security features should include encryption of files at rest and in transit, and an activity log that tracks user actions like uploads, downloads, shares, etc. After implementing security features, write tests to ensure that security features work correctly, that files are encrypted at rest and in transit, and that the activity log correctly tracks user actions."], "step": "Step 10: Implement security features in user_service.py and file_service.py.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
