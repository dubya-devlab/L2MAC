Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. The project will be structured as a Flask application, with separate modules for user management, file management, and file sharing. Create a 'main.py' file as the entry point of the application, and 'user_management.py', 'file_management.py', and 'file_sharing.py' for the respective modules. Also, create a 'utils.py' file for utility functions that will be used across the application. In the 'main.py', import Flask and initialize the application. In the 'user_management.py', 'file_management.py', and 'file_sharing.py', import the necessary Flask modules. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file and add Flask to the list of dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the application runs without errors and that the modules are correctly imported.", "2. Implement the user registration feature in the 'user_management.py' module. This will involve creating a User dataclass with fields for name, email, and password, and a register function that takes a User object and adds it to a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). The register function should check if a user with the same email already exists in the database, and if not, add the new user. After implementing the user registration feature, write tests to ensure that the registration works correctly, that duplicate registrations are prevented, and that the data is correctly stored in the mock database.", "3. Implement the user login feature in the 'user_management.py' module. This will involve creating a login function that takes an email and password, checks if a user with the same email and password exists in the mock database, and if so, returns a success message. Also, implement a forgot password function that takes an email, checks if a user with the same email exists in the mock database, and if so, returns a success message. After implementing the user login and forgot password features, write tests to ensure that the login works correctly, that non-existent users cannot login, and that the forgot password function works correctly.", "4. Implement the user profile feature in the 'user_management.py' module. This will involve creating a UserProfile dataclass with fields for profile picture, name, email, and storage used/remaining, and a get_profile function that takes a User object and returns a UserProfile object. Also, implement a change_password function that takes a User object and a new password, and updates the user's password in the mock database. After implementing the user profile and change password features, write tests to ensure that the profile information is correctly retrieved and that the password is correctly changed.", "5. Implement the file upload and download features in the 'file_management.py' module. This will involve creating a File dataclass with fields for name, type, size, and content, and an upload_file function that takes a File object and adds it to a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). The upload_file function should check the file size and type restrictions. Also, implement a download_file function that takes a file name and returns the corresponding File object from the mock database. After implementing the file upload and download features, write tests to ensure that the upload and download work correctly, that the file size and type restrictions are enforced, and that the data is correctly stored in the mock database.", "6. Implement the file/folder organization and file versioning features in the 'file_management.py' module. This will involve creating a Folder dataclass with fields for name and files, and a create_folder, rename_folder, move_file, and delete_file function that manipulate the Folder objects in the mock database. The file versioning feature can be implemented by maintaining a list of File objects for each file in the mock database, and providing a restore_version function that takes a file name and a version number, and replaces the current version of the file with the specified version. After implementing the file/folder organization and file versioning features, write tests to ensure that the organization and versioning work correctly, and that the data is correctly manipulated in the mock database.", "7. Implement the shareable links and shared folders features in the 'file_sharing.py' module. This will involve creating a ShareableLink dataclass with fields for URL, expiry date, and password, and a generate_link function that takes a File or Folder object and returns a ShareableLink object. The shared folders feature can be implemented by adding a shared_users field to the Folder dataclass, and providing an invite_user function that takes a Folder object and a User object, and adds the user to the folder's shared_users. After implementing the shareable links and shared folders features, write tests to ensure that the links are correctly generated and that the shared folders work correctly.", "8. Implement the encryption and activity log features in the 'utils.py' module. This will involve creating an encrypt function that takes a File object and returns an encrypted File object, and a decrypt function that does the reverse. The activity log feature can be implemented by maintaining a list of ActivityLogEntry objects, each with fields for user, action, and timestamp, and providing a log_activity function that takes a User object and an action, and adds a new ActivityLogEntry to the list. After implementing the encryption and activity log features, write tests to ensure that the encryption and decryption work correctly, and that the activity log is correctly updated.", "9. Implement the responsive design, themes, and file preview features in the 'main.py' module. This will involve creating a render_page function that takes a User object and a page name, and returns a string representing the HTML of the page. The function should adjust the HTML based on the user's preferences for theme and view mode (web, mobile, or tablet). The file preview feature can be implemented by adding a preview field to the File dataclass, and updating the upload_file function to generate a preview for each file. After implementing the UI/UX features, write tests to ensure that the pages are correctly rendered and that the file previews are correctly generated.", "10. Finally, integrate all the modules in the 'main.py' file. This will involve creating routes for each of the features, and calling the appropriate functions from the 'user_management.py', 'file_management.py', 'file_sharing.py', and 'utils.py' modules. After integrating the modules, write tests to ensure that the routes work correctly and that the application functions as expected."], "step": "8.
