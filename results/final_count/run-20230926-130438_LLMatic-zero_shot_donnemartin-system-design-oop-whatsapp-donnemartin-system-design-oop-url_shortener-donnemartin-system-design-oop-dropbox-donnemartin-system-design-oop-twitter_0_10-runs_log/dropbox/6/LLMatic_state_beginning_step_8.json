Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. The project will be structured as a Flask application, with separate modules for each major feature (user management, file management, file sharing, and security). Create a 'main.py' file as the entry point of the application, and create separate directories for 'user_management', 'file_management', 'file_sharing', and 'security'. In each directory, create an '__init__.py' file to make them Python packages, and a 'routes.py' file to define the routes related to each feature. Also, create a 'templates' directory for storing HTML templates, and a 'static' directory for storing static files like CSS and JavaScript. Finally, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list the project dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application runs correctly.", "2. Implement the user registration feature. In the 'user_management' module, create a 'models.py' file to define a User dataclass with fields for name, email, and password. In the 'routes.py' file, define a route for the registration page that displays a form for the user to enter their name, email, and password. When the form is submitted, create a new User instance and store it in an in-memory dictionary that acts as a mock database. Write a test to ensure that the registration feature works correctly, by simulating a form submission and checking that the new user is stored in the mock database.", "3. Implement the user login feature. In the 'user_management' module, define a route for the login page that displays a form for the user to enter their email and password. When the form is submitted, check the entered email and password against the stored users in the mock database. If the credentials are correct, set a session variable to indicate that the user is logged in. Also, implement a 'forgot password' feature that allows the user to reset their password by entering their email. Write a test to ensure that the login and forgot password features work correctly.", "4. Implement the user profile feature. In the 'user_management' module, define a route for the profile page that displays the user's profile picture, name, email, and storage used/remaining. Also, provide a form for the user to change their password. Write a test to ensure that the profile page displays the correct information and that the password change feature works correctly.", "5. Implement the file upload and download features. In the 'file_management' module, create a 'models.py' file to define a File dataclass with fields for the file name, type, size, and content. Define routes for the file upload and download pages. The upload page should display a form that allows the user to select a file from their device and upload it. The download page should provide a direct download link for each uploaded file. Write a test to ensure that the file upload and download features work correctly.", "6. Implement the file/folder organization and file versioning features. In the 'file_management' module, define routes for creating, renaming, moving, and deleting files/folders. Also, maintain a history of file versions and provide an option to restore a file to a previous version. Write a test to ensure that the file/folder organization and file versioning features work correctly.", "7. Implement the file sharing feature. In the 'file_sharing' module, define a route for generating shareable URL links for files/folders. Also, provide options for setting an expiry date and password protection for the links. In addition, implement a feature for inviting users via email to shared folders and setting permissions for them. Write a test to ensure that the file sharing feature works correctly.", "8. Implement the security features. In the 'security' module, implement encryption for files at rest and in transit. Also, maintain an activity log that tracks user actions like uploads, downloads, shares, etc. Write a test to ensure that the security features work correctly.", "9. Implement the UI/UX features. Create HTML templates for each page of the application, and use CSS and JavaScript to make the design responsive and provide light and dark themes. Also, provide thumbnails for images and videos, and document viewers for common file types. Write a test to ensure that the UI/UX features work correctly.", "10. Finally, integrate all the features and test the entire application. Ensure that all routes are correctly defined and that the application behaves as expected when different features are used together. Write a comprehensive test that simulates a user journey through the application, from registration to file upload, download, sharing, and deletion. Ensure that all tests pass and that the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "9. Implement the UI/UX features.

When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}], "message_hash": "b157aecd598dba5a9683257d0d703fa407ba17b604f63395e8121ad10d07c2ae"}
