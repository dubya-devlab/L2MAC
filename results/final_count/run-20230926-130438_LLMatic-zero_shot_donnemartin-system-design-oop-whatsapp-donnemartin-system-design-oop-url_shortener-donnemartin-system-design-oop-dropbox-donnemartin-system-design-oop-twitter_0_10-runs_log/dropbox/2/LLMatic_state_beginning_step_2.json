Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. The project will be structured as a Flask application, with separate modules for each major feature (user management, file management, file sharing, and security). Create a 'main.py' file as the entry point of the application, and create separate directories for templates (HTML files), static files (CSS, JavaScript, images), and tests. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list all the necessary Python packages. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the user registration feature. This will involve creating a 'User' dataclass to represent a user, and a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database. The 'User' dataclass should include fields for name, email, password, profile picture, and storage used. The registration feature should include validation to ensure that the email is not already in use, and that the password meets certain security requirements. After implementing the registration feature, write a test to ensure that a user can be successfully registered and stored in the 'users' dictionary.", "3. Implement the user login feature. This will involve checking the 'users' dictionary to see if a user with the given email exists, and if so, whether the given password matches the stored password. If the login is successful, the user's information should be stored in the session. Also implement a 'forgot password' feature, which for now can simply reset the user's password to a default value. After implementing the login feature, write a test to ensure that a user can be successfully logged in and out, and that the 'forgot password' feature works correctly.", "4. Implement the user profile feature. This will involve creating a route that displays the user's profile information, and a form that allows the user to change their password. The profile page should also display the amount of storage used and remaining. After implementing the profile feature, write a test to ensure that the profile page displays the correct information, and that the password change feature works correctly.", "5. Implement the file upload feature. This will involve creating a 'File' dataclass to represent a file, and a 'files' dictionary to act as a mock database. The 'File' dataclass should include fields for name, size, type, and version history. The upload feature should include validation to ensure that the file size and type are within the allowed limits. After implementing the upload feature, write a test to ensure that a file can be successfully uploaded and stored in the 'files' dictionary.", "6. Implement the file download and organization features. The download feature should provide a direct download link for each file, and an option to download a folder as a ZIP file. The organization feature should allow the user to create folders, and to rename, move, and delete files and folders. After implementing these features, write a test to ensure that files can be successfully downloaded and organized.", "7. Implement the file versioning feature. This will involve maintaining a history of each file's versions, and providing an option to restore a file to a previous version. After implementing this feature, write a test to ensure that file versioning works correctly.", "8. Implement the file sharing feature. This will involve creating shareable URL links for files and folders, with options for expiry date and password protection. Also implement a feature to allow users to invite others to shared folders, with options to set permissions. After implementing these features, write a test to ensure that file sharing works correctly.", "9. Implement the security features. This will involve encrypting files at rest and in transit, and maintaining a log of user actions. After implementing these features, write a test to ensure that file encryption and activity logging work correctly.", "10. Finally, implement the UI/UX features. This will involve creating responsive design templates for all pages, offering light and dark themes, and providing file previews for common file types. After implementing these features, write a test to ensure that the UI/UX features work correctly."], "step": "3. Implement the user login feature. This will involve checking the 'users' dictionary to see if a user with the given email exists, and if so, whether the given password matches the stored password.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
