Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. The project will be structured as a Flask application, with separate modules for each major feature (user management, file management, file sharing, and security). Create a 'main.py' file as the entry point of the application, and create separate Python files for each module ('user_management.py', 'file_management.py', 'file_sharing.py', 'security.py'). Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list all the necessary dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and all necessary files are present.", "2. Implement the user registration feature in the 'user_management.py' module. This will involve creating a User class with attributes for name, email, and password, and a function to register a new user. The function should validate the input data (ensure the email is valid and the password is strong), and then add the new user to a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). After implementing the user registration feature, write a test to ensure that the function correctly validates input data and adds new users to the database.", "3. Implement the user login feature in the 'user_management.py' module. This will involve creating a function to authenticate a user based on their email and password. The function should check if the provided email and password match a user in the mock database. If they do, the function should return a success message; otherwise, it should return an error message. After implementing the user login feature, write a test to ensure that the function correctly authenticates users.", "4. Implement the file upload feature in the 'file_management.py' module. This will involve creating a File class with attributes for the file name, type, size, and content, and a function to upload a new file. The function should validate the input data (ensure the file type is allowed and the file size does not exceed the limit), and then add the new file to a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). After implementing the file upload feature, write a test to ensure that the function correctly validates input data and adds new files to the database.", "5. Implement the file download feature in the 'file_management.py' module. This will involve creating a function to download a file based on its name. The function should check if the provided name matches a file in the mock database. If it does, the function should return the file content; otherwise, it should return an error message. After implementing the file download feature, write a test to ensure that the function correctly downloads files.", "6. Implement the file sharing feature in the 'file_sharing.py' module. This will involve creating a function to generate a shareable link for a file. The function should take a file name as input, and return a URL that can be used to download the file. After implementing the file sharing feature, write a test to ensure that the function correctly generates shareable links.", "7. Implement the encryption feature in the 'security.py' module. This will involve creating a function to encrypt a file's content, and a function to decrypt it. The encryption function should take a file's content as input, and return the encrypted content. The decryption function should do the opposite. After implementing the encryption feature, write a test to ensure that the functions correctly encrypt and decrypt file content.", "8. Implement the activity log feature in the 'security.py' module. This will involve creating a Log class with attributes for the user, action, and timestamp, and a function to add a new log entry. The function should add the new log entry to a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). After implementing the activity log feature, write a test to ensure that the function correctly adds new log entries to the database.", "9. Implement the user interface for the application in the 'main.py' file. This will involve creating Flask routes for each feature (user registration, user login, file upload, file download, file sharing, encryption, and activity log), and rendering appropriate HTML templates for each route. After implementing the user interface, write a test to ensure that each route is working correctly and renders the correct template.", "10. Finally, run all the tests to ensure that all features are working correctly. If any tests fail, debug the corresponding feature and fix the issue.
