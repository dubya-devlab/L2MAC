The project will be structured as a Flask application, with a main app.py file serving as the entry point. Create a 'models' directory to hold the data models for User and File. In the 'models' directory, create user.py and file.py. Also, create a 'services' directory to hold the business logic for user management, file management, and file sharing. In the 'services' directory, create user_service.py, file_service.py, and share_service.py. Finally, create a 'tests' directory to hold the test files. In the 'tests' directory, create test_user.py, test_file.py, and test_share.py. After setting up the project structure, create a requirements.txt file to list the project dependencies. The dependencies will include Flask, pytest, and any other necessary libraries. After creating the files and requirements.txt, write a test to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and all necessary files exist.", "Step 2: Implement the User data model. The User model will have fields for id, name, email, password, profile picture, and storage used. The id will be a unique identifier for each user. The name, email, and password will be used for registration and login. The profile picture will be a URL to the user's profile picture. The storage used will be a number representing the amount of storage the user has used. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that the User model is working correctly. The tests should create a User object, set and get the fields, and check that the fields are correctly set.", "Step 3: Implement the File data model. The File model will have fields for id, name, type, size, version, and owner. The id will be a unique identifier for each file. The name will be the file's name. The type will be the file's type (e.g., 'jpg', 'pdf'). The size will be the file's size in bytes. The version will be a number representing the file's version. The owner will be a reference to the User who owns the file. After implementing the File model, write tests to ensure that the File model is working correctly. The tests should create a File object, set and get the fields, and check that the fields are correctly set.", "Step 4: Implement the user registration functionality in user_service.py. The registration function will take a name, email, and password, create a new User object, and add it to the database. The function will also check that the email is not already in use. After implementing the registration function, write tests to ensure that the function is working correctly. The tests should register a user and check that the user is added to the database and that the email is unique.", "Step 5: Implement the user login functionality in user_service.py. The login function will take an email and password, check that a User with the given email and password exists in the database, and return the User if it exists. The function will also handle the 'forgot password' functionality by generating a temporary password and sending it to the user's email. After implementing the login function, write tests to ensure that the function is working correctly. The tests should login a user and check that the correct User is returned and that the 'forgot password' functionality works.", "Step 6: Implement the user profile functionality in user_service.py. The profile function will take a User id, retrieve the User from the database, and return the User's profile information (name, email, profile picture, storage used). The function will also handle the 'change password' functionality by updating the User's password in the database. After implementing the profile function, write tests to ensure that the function is working correctly. The tests should retrieve a user's profile and check that the correct information is returned and that the 'change password' functionality works.", "Step 7: Implement the file upload functionality in file_service.py. The upload function will take a file, check that the file's size and type are within the allowed limits, create a new File object, and add it to the database. The function will also update the User's storage used. After implementing the upload function, write tests to ensure that the function is working correctly. The tests should upload a file and check that the file is added to the database, that the file's size and type are checked, and that the User's storage used is updated.", "Step 8: Implement the file download functionality in file_service.py. The download function will take a File id, retrieve the File from the database, and return a download link. The function will also handle the 'download folder as ZIP' functionality by creating a ZIP file of the folder and returning a download link. After implementing the download function, write tests to ensure that the function is working correctly. The tests should download a file and check that the correct download link is returned and that the 'download folder as ZIP' functionality works.", "Step 9: Implement the file sharing functionality in share_service.py. The share function will take a File id and a User id, create a shareable link, and send the link to the User's email. The function will also handle the 'shared folders' functionality by allowing a User to invite other Users to a folder and set their permissions. After implementing the share function, write tests to ensure that the function is working correctly. The tests should share a file and check that the correct link is sent and that the 'shared folders' functionality works.", "Step 10: Implement the activity log functionality in user_service.py. The log function will take a User id and an action (e.g., 'upload', 'download', 'share'), add the action to the User's activity log, and return the updated log. After implementing the log function, write tests to ensure that the function is working correctly. The tests should log an action and check that the action is added to the User's activity log."], "step": "Step 9: Implement the file sharing functionality in share_service.py.
