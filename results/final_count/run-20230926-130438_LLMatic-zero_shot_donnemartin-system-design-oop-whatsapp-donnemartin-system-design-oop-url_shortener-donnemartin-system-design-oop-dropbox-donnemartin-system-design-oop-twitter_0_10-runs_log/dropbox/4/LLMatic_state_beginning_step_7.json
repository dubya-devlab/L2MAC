["1. Start by setting up the project structure and the necessary files. Create a new Python Flask application and structure the project into appropriate directories such as 'models', 'controllers', 'services', 'utils', etc. Create a 'main.py' file which will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to manage the project dependencies. The main dependencies will be Flask, its security extension Flask-Security for user authentication and session management, and pytest for testing. After setting up the project structure and dependencies, write tests to ensure that the project setup is correct and the application runs without errors.", "2. Implement the User Account Management feature. Start by creating a 'User' model in the 'models' directory. The User model should have fields for name, email, password, profile picture, and storage used. Then, create a 'user_service.py' in the 'services' directory. This service will handle the business logic related to user management such as registration, login, password reset, and profile management. Implement the registration, login, and forgot password functionalities first. Write tests for each of these functionalities to ensure they work as expected.", "3. Continue with the User Account Management feature by implementing the user profile functionality. The profile should display the user's name, email, profile picture, and storage used/remaining. Also, provide an option for the user to change their password. Write tests to ensure that the profile displays the correct information and the password change functionality works correctly.", "4. Implement the File Management feature. Start by creating a 'File' model in the 'models' directory. The File model should have fields for file name, file type, file size, upload date, and version history. Then, create a 'file_service.py' in the 'services' directory. This service will handle the business logic related to file management such as file upload, download, organization, and versioning. Implement the file upload and download functionalities first. Write tests for each of these functionalities to ensure they work as expected.", "5. Continue with the File Management feature by implementing the file/folder organization functionality. Users should be able to create folders and rename, move, and delete files/folders. Then, implement the file versioning functionality. The system should maintain historical versions of files and give users an option to restore to previous versions. Write tests to ensure that the file/folder organization and file versioning functionalities work correctly.", "6. Implement the File Sharing feature. Start by creating a 'Share' model in the 'models' directory. The Share model should have fields for the file/folder being shared, the user it is being shared with, the permissions granted, and any password protection or expiry date. Then, create a 'share_service.py' in the 'services' directory. This service will handle the business logic related to file sharing such as generating shareable links and managing shared folders. Implement the shareable links functionality first. Write tests to ensure that the shareable links functionality works correctly.", "7. Continue with the File Sharing feature by implementing the shared folders functionality. Users should be able to invite other users to shared folders via email and set permissions for them. Write tests to ensure that the shared folders functionality works correctly.", "8. Implement the Security feature. Start by ensuring that all files are encrypted at rest and in transit. Then, create an 'ActivityLog' model in the 'models' directory. The ActivityLog model should have fields for the user, the action performed, and the date/time of the action. Then, create a 'security_service.py' in the 'services' directory. This service will handle the business logic related to security such as encryption and activity logging. Implement the activity logging functionality. Write tests to ensure that the encryption and activity logging functionalities work correctly.", "9. Implement the UI/UX feature. Start by ensuring that the design is responsive and suitable for web, mobile, and tablet views. Then, implement the themes functionality to offer light and dark modes. Finally, implement the file preview functionality to provide thumbnails for images/videos and document viewers for common file types. Write tests to ensure that the UI/UX functionalities work correctly.", "10. After all the features have been implemented, perform a final round of testing. Run all the tests written in the previous steps to ensure that all the functionalities work as expected. Also, perform some manual testing to check the user experience and the overall functionality of the application.
