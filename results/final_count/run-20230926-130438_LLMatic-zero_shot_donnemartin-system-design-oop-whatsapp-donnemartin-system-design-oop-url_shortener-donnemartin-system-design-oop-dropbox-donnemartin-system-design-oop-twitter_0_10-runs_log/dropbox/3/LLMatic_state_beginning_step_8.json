Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. This includes the main application file (app.py), a file for user management (user.py), a file for file management (file.py), a file for sharing functionality (share.py), a file for security features (security.py), and a file for UI/UX (ui.py). Also, create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that all files are created and exist in the correct locations.", "2. Implement the User Registration feature in the user.py file. This includes creating a User class with attributes for name, email, and password. Also, create a register method that takes these attributes as parameters and adds a new user to a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). After implementing this feature, write a test to ensure that a new user can be registered and added to the database.", "3. Implement the User Login feature in the user.py file. This includes creating a login method that takes email and password as parameters and checks if a user with these credentials exists in the database. Also, implement the Forgot Password functionality by creating a forgot_password method that takes an email as a parameter and resets the password for the user with this email. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a user can login with valid credentials, and that the password for a user can be reset.", "4. Implement the User Profile feature in the user.py file. This includes creating a profile method that takes a user's email as a parameter and returns the user's profile information (name, email, profile picture, storage used/remaining). Also, create a change_password method that takes a user's email and new password as parameters and updates the user's password in the database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a user's profile information can be retrieved and that a user's password can be changed.", "5. Implement the File Upload and Download features in the file.py file. This includes creating a File class with attributes for file name, type, size, and content. Also, create an upload method that takes a file as a parameter and adds it to a mock file database (another in-memory dictionary). Create a download method that takes a file name as a parameter and returns the file from the database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that a file can be uploaded and downloaded.", "6. Implement the File/Folder Organization and File Versioning features in the file.py file. This includes creating methods for creating folders, renaming, moving, and deleting files/folders. Also, create a versioning system that keeps track of different versions of a file and allows users to restore a file to a previous version. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that files/folders can be organized and that file versions can be managed.", "7. Implement the Shareable Links and Shared Folders features in the share.py file. This includes creating methods for generating shareable links for files/folders, setting expiry dates and password protection for these links, inviting users to shared folders, and setting permissions for these users. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that shareable links can be generated and managed, and that shared folders can be created and managed.", "8. Implement the Encryption and Activity Log features in the security.py file. This includes creating methods for encrypting and decrypting files, and for logging user activities such as uploads, downloads, and shares. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that files can be encrypted and decrypted, and that user activities can be logged.", "9. Implement the Responsive Design, Themes, and File Preview features in the ui.py file. This includes creating methods for adjusting the UI based on the user's device, switching between light and dark modes, and generating thumbnails and document viewers for different file types. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the UI can be adjusted, themes can be switched, and file previews can be generated.", "10. Finally, integrate all the features in the main application file (app.py). This includes setting up routes for user registration, login, profile management, file upload, download, organization, versioning, sharing, and security. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that all routes are working as expected and that all features are integrated correctly."], "step": "9.
