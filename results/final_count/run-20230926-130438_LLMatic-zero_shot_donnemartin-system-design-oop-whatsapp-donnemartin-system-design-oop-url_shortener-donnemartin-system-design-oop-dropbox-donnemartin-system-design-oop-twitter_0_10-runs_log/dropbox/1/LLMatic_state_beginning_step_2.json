Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. The project will be structured as a Flask application, with a main app.py file serving as the entry point. Create a 'models' directory for data models, a 'routes' directory for route handlers, a 'services' directory for business logic, and a 'tests' directory for test cases. Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up and all necessary files are present.", "2. Implement the User model in the 'models' directory. This model will represent a user in the system and will have fields for name, email, password, profile picture, and storage used. The password field should be hashed for security. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that the User model is correctly implemented and that the password hashing works correctly.", "3. Implement the File model in the 'models' directory. This model will represent a file in the system and will have fields for name, type, size, upload date, owner (a reference to a User), and a list of versions. Each version will be represented by a Version model, which will have fields for version number, upload date, and file data. After implementing the File and Version models, write tests to ensure that these models are correctly implemented.", "4. Implement the Folder model in the 'models' directory. This model will represent a folder in the system and will have fields for name, creation date, owner (a reference to a User), and a list of files (references to File models). After implementing the Folder model, write tests to ensure that the Folder model is correctly implemented.", "5. Implement the user registration, login, and profile viewing functionality in the 'routes' and 'services' directories. The registration route should accept a name, email, and password, create a new User model, and save it. The login route should accept an email and password, authenticate the user, and return a session token. The profile viewing route should accept a session token and return the corresponding User model. After implementing these functionalities, write tests to ensure that they work correctly.", "6. Implement the file upload, download, and organization functionality in the 'routes' and 'services' directories. The file upload route should accept a file, create a new File model, and save it. The file download route should accept a file ID and return the corresponding File model. The file organization routes should allow creating, renaming, moving, and deleting files and folders. After implementing these functionalities, write tests to ensure that they work correctly.", "7. Implement the file versioning functionality in the 'routes' and 'services' directories. The file versioning route should accept a file ID and a new file, create a new Version model, and add it to the File model's list of versions. The file restoration route should accept a file ID and a version number, and update the File model's current version to the specified version. After implementing these functionalities, write tests to ensure that they work correctly.", "8. Implement the file sharing functionality in the 'routes' and 'services' directories. The file sharing route should accept a file ID, an email, and permissions, and create a shareable link. The shared folder route should accept a folder ID, an email, and permissions, and create a shareable link. After implementing these functionalities, write tests to ensure that they work correctly.", "9. Implement the encryption and activity log functionality in the 'routes' and 'services' directories. The encryption should be applied to the file data in the File and Version models. The activity log should track user actions like uploads, downloads, shares, etc., and be viewable by the user. After implementing these functionalities, write tests to ensure that they work correctly.", "10. Finally, implement the UI/UX requirements. This will involve creating HTML templates for the various pages, implementing responsive design, and adding features like themes and file previews. After implementing the UI/UX requirements, write tests to ensure that they work correctly."], "step": "3. Implement the File model in the 'models' directory. This model will represent a file in the system and will have fields for name, type, size, upload date, owner (a reference to a User), and a list of versions.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
