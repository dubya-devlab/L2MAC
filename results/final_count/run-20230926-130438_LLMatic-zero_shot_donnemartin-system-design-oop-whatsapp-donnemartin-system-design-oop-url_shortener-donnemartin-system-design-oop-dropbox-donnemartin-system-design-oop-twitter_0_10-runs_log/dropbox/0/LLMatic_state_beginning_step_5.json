Create a 'models' directory for data models, a 'routes' directory for route handlers, and a 'services' directory for business logic. Also, create a 'tests' directory for test cases. The 'models' directory will contain User.py and File.py, representing the User and File entities respectively. The 'routes' directory will contain user_routes.py and file_routes.py, handling requests related to users and files respectively. The 'services' directory will contain user_service.py and file_service.py, encapsulating the business logic for users and files respectively. Finally, create a requirements.txt file to list the project dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up and all necessary files are present.", "2. Implement the User data model. The User model will have fields for id, name, email, password, profile picture, and storage used.

Implement the __init__, __repr__, and to_dict methods for the User model. After implementing the User model, write tests to ensure that the User model is correctly implemented and all methods work as expected.", "3. Implement the File data model. The File model will have fields for id, name, type, size, path, owner (a reference to the User who owns the file), and versions (a list of previous versions of the file). The id will be a unique identifier, the name, type, and size will be used for file management, the path will be used for file organization, the owner will be used for file ownership, and the versions will be used for file versioning.

In the file_service.py file, write functions to create a folder, rename a file/folder, move a file/folder, and delete a file/folder. These functions will take in the necessary parameters, perform the corresponding operations on the File instances in the in-memory database, and return the updated file/folder details. In the file_routes.py file, write route handlers for the file organization endpoints. These route handlers will take in requests with the necessary parameters, call the corresponding functions in the file_service, and return responses with the updated file/folder details. After implementing the file organization functionality, write tests to ensure that the file organization functions and route handlers work as expected.", "9. Implement the file sharing functionality. In the file_service.py file, write a function to generate a shareable link for a file/folder. This function will take in a file/folder id, create a unique shareable link for the File instance with the given id, and return the shareable link. In the file_routes.py file, write a route handler for the file sharing endpoint. This route handler will take in a request with the file/folder id, call the shareable link generation function in the file_service, and return a response with the shareable link. After implementing the file sharing functionality, write tests to ensure that the shareable link generation function and route handler work as expected.", "10. Implement the user profile functionality. In the user_service.py file, write a function to get a user's profile.
