Create a new Python Flask application with the following files: `app.py` (the main application file), `models.py` (for database models), `views.py` (for handling HTTP requests), `utils.py` (for utility functions), and `tests.py` (for unit tests). Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the Python packages needed for this project. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the User model in the `models.py` file. The User model should have fields for username, password, and a list of URLs that the user has shortened. Also, implement the URL model. The URL model should have fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who created it, the creation date, the expiration date, and a list of click events. Each click event should record the date/time of the click and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing the models, write tests to ensure that the models are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the URL shortening feature. In the `utils.py` file, write a function to generate a unique shortened URL. This function should take an original URL as input and return a shortened URL. The function should also validate that the original URL is active and legitimate. In the `views.py` file, implement an HTTP POST endpoint where users can submit URLs to be shortened. This endpoint should use the URL shortening function from `utils.py` to generate a shortened URL and save it to the database. After implementing the URL shortening feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the custom short link feature. Modify the URL shortening function in `utils.py` to accept an optional custom short link as input. If a custom short link is provided, the function should use it as the shortened URL, provided that it is unique. Modify the URL shortening endpoint in `views.py` to accept an optional custom short link in the request body. After implementing the custom short link feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the redirection feature. In the `views.py` file, implement an HTTP GET endpoint for the shortened URLs. When this endpoint is accessed, it should redirect to the original URL. It should also record a click event with the current date/time and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the analytics feature. In the `views.py` file, implement an HTTP GET endpoint where users can view statistics about their shortened URLs. This endpoint should return the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of each clicker. After implementing the analytics feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the user accounts feature. In the `views.py` file, implement HTTP endpoints for user registration, login, and logout. The registration endpoint should create a new User in the database. The login endpoint should authenticate the user and start a new session. The logout endpoint should end the current session. After implementing the user accounts feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the user dashboard feature. In the `views.py` file, implement an HTTP GET endpoint where logged-in users can view all their shortened URLs, edit their URLs, and delete their URLs. This endpoint should also allow users to view analytics for all their shortened URLs. After implementing the user dashboard feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In the `views.py` file, implement an HTTP GET endpoint where administrators can view all shortened URLs, delete any URL, and delete any user account. This endpoint should also allow administrators to monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing the admin dashboard feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 10: Implement the expiration feature. Modify the URL model in `models.py` to include an expiration date/time. Modify the URL shortening function in `utils.py` to accept an optional expiration date/time as input. If an expiration date/time is provided, the function should set it on the URL. Modify the redirection endpoint in `views.py` to check the expiration date/time before redirecting. If the URL has expired, the endpoint should return an error. After implementing the expiration feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly."], "step": "Step 1: Start by setting up the project structure and the necessary files.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
