Create a new Flask application and set up the basic structure with the necessary files and folders. The main files will include 'app.py' for the application entry point, 'requirements.txt' for the project dependencies, and 'config.py' for the application configuration. Also, create a 'services' folder to hold the service classes and a 'tests' folder for the test files. Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a new service class 'UrlShortener' in the 'services' folder. This class will have methods for validating URLs, generating unique shortened URLs, and storing the mapping between the original and shortened URLs in an in-memory dictionary. The dictionary will act as a mock database. Write tests for each method in the 'UrlShortener' class to ensure they work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. Add a new route in 'app.py' that takes a shortened URL as a parameter and redirects to the original URL. The route handler will use the 'UrlShortener' service to look up the original URL. Write a test to ensure that accessing a shortened URL redirects to the correct original URL.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Extend the 'UrlShortener' service to keep track of the number of clicks, date/time of each click, and geographical location of the clicker for each shortened URL. The geographical location can be mocked as we don't have access to a real IP address. Write tests to ensure that the analytics data is correctly recorded and retrieved.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a new service class 'UserAccount' in the 'services' folder. This class will have methods for creating accounts, viewing all shortened URLs of a user, editing or deleting shortened URLs, and viewing analytics for all shortened URLs. The user data and their associated URLs will be stored in an in-memory dictionary. Write tests for each method in the 'UserAccount' class to ensure they work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create a new service class 'AdminDashboard' in the 'services' folder. This class will have methods for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. Write tests for each method in the 'AdminDashboard' class to ensure they work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the URL expiration feature. Extend the 'UrlShortener' service to allow setting an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. The service should check the expiration date/time before redirecting a shortened URL and return an error if the URL has expired. Write a test to ensure that an expired URL cannot be accessed.", "Step 8: Integrate the service classes with the Flask application. Add routes in 'app.py' for each feature, using the corresponding service class to handle the requests. The routes should include error handling to return appropriate responses when an error occurs. Write tests to ensure that each route works as expected and returns the correct response.", "Step 9: Implement the custom short link feature. Extend the 'UrlShortener' service to allow users to choose custom short links. The service should check if the custom link is available and return an error if it's not. Write a test to ensure that users can choose custom short links and that the service correctly handles unavailable links.", "Step 10: Finally, run all the tests to ensure that all features work as expected.
