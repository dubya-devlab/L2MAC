Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list all the Python packages required for this project. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the User model in 'models.py'. The User model should have fields for username, password, and a list of URLs that the user has shortened. Also, implement the URL model. The URL model should have fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who created it, the creation date, the expiration date, and a list of click events. Each click event should record the date/time of the click and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing the models, write tests to ensure that the models are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the URL shortening feature. In 'utils.py', write a function to generate a unique shortened URL. The function should take an original URL as input and return a shortened URL. The function should also check if the original URL is active and legitimate. If the user chooses a custom short link, the function should check if the custom link is available. If it is not available, the function should return an error. After implementing the URL shortening feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the redirection feature. In 'views.py', write a route that takes a shortened URL as input and redirects to the original URL. The route should also record a click event each time the shortened URL is accessed. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the analytics feature. In 'views.py', write a route that takes a shortened URL as input and returns statistics about the URL. The statistics should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of each clicker. After implementing the analytics feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the user accounts feature. In 'views.py', write routes for user registration, login, and logout. Also, write a route that allows a logged-in user to view all their shortened URLs. After implementing the user accounts feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In 'views.py', write a route that allows an administrator to view all shortened URLs and all user accounts. Also, write routes that allow an administrator to delete any URL or user account. After implementing the admin dashboard feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration feature. In 'views.py', write a route that allows a user to set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. The route should check if the user is the owner of the URL before allowing the operation. After implementing the URL expiration feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the system performance monitoring feature. In 'views.py', write a route that allows an administrator to view system performance statistics. The statistics should include the total number of URLs, the total number of users, and the total number of clicks. After implementing the system performance monitoring feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, run all the tests to ensure that all features are working correctly.
