"steps": ["Step 1: Start by setting up the project structure and the necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and requests (for URL validation). Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain a function to generate a unique shortened URL. The function should take a URL as input and return a shortened version of it. The shortened URL can be generated by hashing the original URL and taking a substring of the hash. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly generates unique shortened URLs.", "Step 3: Implement the URL validation feature. In the `url_shortener.py` file, add a function to validate that a given URL is active and legitimate. The function should send a GET request to the URL and check the response status. If the status is 200, the URL is valid. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly validates URLs.", "Step 4: Implement the feature for users to choose custom short links. Modify the URL shortening function to accept an optional parameter for a custom short link. If the parameter is provided, use it as the shortened URL instead of generating one. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly handles custom short links.", "Step 5: Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that matches the pattern of the shortened URLs. When a GET request is made to this route, the application should redirect to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain functions to track and retrieve statistics about shortened URLs. The statistics should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. Write tests to ensure that the analytics functions work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain functions to handle user account operations such as creating an account, viewing all shortened URLs of a user, editing or deleting a shortened URL, and viewing analytics for all shortened URLs of a user. Write tests to ensure that the user account functions work correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In the `admin_dashboard.py` file, add functions to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functions work correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the expiration feature. Modify the URL shortening function to accept an optional parameter for an expiration date/time. If the parameter is provided, the shortened URL should become inactive after the specified date/time. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature works correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, integrate all the features in the `app.py` file. Add routes for each feature and ensure that they work correctly together. Write tests to ensure that the entire application works as expected."], "step": "Step 9: Implement the expiration feature.
