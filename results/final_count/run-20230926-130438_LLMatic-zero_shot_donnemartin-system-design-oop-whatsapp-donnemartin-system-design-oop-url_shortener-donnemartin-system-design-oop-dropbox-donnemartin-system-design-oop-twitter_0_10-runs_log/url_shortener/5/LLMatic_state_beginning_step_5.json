Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store the data. The data to be stored includes user accounts, shortened URLs, and analytics data. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and the routes are working as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a function that takes a URL as input, validates the URL, and generates a unique shortened URL. The function should also handle the case where a user wants to use a custom short link. After implementing the URL shortening feature, write tests to ensure that the function correctly validates URLs and generates unique shortened URLs.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. Create a function that takes a shortened URL as input and redirects to the original URL. The function should handle the case where the shortened URL does not exist in the database. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that the function correctly redirects to the original URL.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Create a function that takes a shortened URL as input and returns statistics about the URL. The statistics should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing the analytics feature, write tests to ensure that the function correctly returns the statistics.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create functions for creating an account, viewing all shortened URLs associated with an account, editing a shortened URL, and deleting a shortened URL. After implementing the user accounts feature, write tests to ensure that the functions correctly handle user accounts and their associated URLs.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create functions for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. After implementing the admin dashboard feature, write tests to ensure that the functions correctly handle admin operations.", "Step 7: Implement the expiration feature. Create a function that allows users to set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. The function should handle the case where a user tries to access an expired URL. After implementing the expiration feature, write tests to ensure that the function correctly handles URL expiration.", "Step 8: Integrate all the features into the Flask application. Update the routes to use the functions implemented in the previous steps. After integrating the features, write tests to ensure that the Flask application works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement error handling for the Flask application. The application should return appropriate error messages for different types of errors, such as invalid input, non-existent URL, expired URL, etc. After implementing error handling, write tests to ensure that the application correctly handles errors.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire codebase to ensure that it follows best practices for Python and Flask.

Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
