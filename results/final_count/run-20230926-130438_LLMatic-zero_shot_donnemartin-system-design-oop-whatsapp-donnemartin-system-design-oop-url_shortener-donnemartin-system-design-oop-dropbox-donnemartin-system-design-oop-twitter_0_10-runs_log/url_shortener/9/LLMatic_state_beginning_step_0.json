Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and dataclasses. Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain a `URLShortener` class. This class will have methods for validating URLs, generating unique shortened URLs, and allowing users to choose custom short links. The class will use an in-memory dictionary to store the original and shortened URLs. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature works as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that will handle the redirection from the shortened URL to the original URL. The route will use the `URLShortener` class to look up the original URL and redirect to it. Write tests to ensure that the redirection feature works as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain an `Analytics` class. This class will have methods for recording and retrieving statistics about the shortened URLs. The class will use an in-memory dictionary to store the analytics data. Write tests to ensure that the analytics feature works as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain a `UserAccounts` class. This class will have methods for creating accounts, viewing all shortened URLs of a user, editing or deleting shortened URLs, and viewing analytics for all shortened URLs. The class will use an in-memory dictionary to store the user account data. Write tests to ensure that the user accounts feature works as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create a `admin_dashboard.py` file that will contain an `AdminDashboard` class. This class will have methods for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. The class will use the `UserAccounts` and `Analytics` classes to perform its operations. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature works as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the expiration feature. Modify the `URLShortener` class to allow users to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. The class will check the expiration date/time before redirecting to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature works as expected.", "Step 8: Integrate all the features in the Flask application. In the `app.py` file, use the `URLShortener`, `Analytics`, `UserAccounts`, and `AdminDashboard` classes to implement the routes for the different features. Write tests to ensure that the integration of the features works as expected.", "Step 9: Perform a final review of the code and tests. Ensure that the code follows best practices and that all the tests pass. If necessary, refactor the code and update the tests.", "Step 10: Document the project. Write a README file that explains how to set up and run the project, and how to use the different features.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
