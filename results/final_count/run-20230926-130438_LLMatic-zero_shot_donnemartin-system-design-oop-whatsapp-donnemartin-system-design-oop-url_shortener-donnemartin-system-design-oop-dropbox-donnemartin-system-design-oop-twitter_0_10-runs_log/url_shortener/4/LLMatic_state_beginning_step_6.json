setting up the project structure and the necessary files. Create a new Python Flask application with the following files: `app.py` (the main application file), `models.py` (for database models), `views.py` (for handling routes and views), `services.py` (for business logic), `utils.py` (for utility functions), and `tests.py` (for unit tests). Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to manage Python dependencies. The last task in this step is to write tests to ensure that the project structure and files are correctly set up.", "Step 2: Implement the User model in the `models.py` file. The User model should have fields for username, password, and a list of URLs that the user has shortened. Implement the URL model as well, which should have fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who created it, the creation date, the expiration date, and a list of click events. Each click event should store the date/time of the click and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing these models, write tests to ensure that they are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement user registration and login functionality in the `views.py` file. Users should be able to register with a username and password, and login with those credentials. Use Flask's session management to keep users logged in between requests. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that user registration and login are working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the URL shortening functionality in the `services.py` file. Users should be able to input a URL to be shortened, and the system should validate that the URL is active and legitimate. The system should then generate a unique shortened URL, or use a custom short link provided by the user if it is available. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that URL shortening is working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the URL redirection functionality in the `views.py` file. When a shortened URL is accessed, the system should redirect to the original URL. It should also record a click event with the current date/time and geographical location. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that URL redirection and click event recording are working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the URL analytics functionality in the `services.py` file. Users should be able to view statistics about their shortened URLs, including the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of each clicker. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that URL analytics are working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the user account management functionality in the `views.py` file. Users should be able to view all their shortened URLs, and edit or delete them. They should also be able to view analytics for all their shortened URLs. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that user account management is working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the admin dashboard functionality in the `views.py` file. Administrators should be able to view all shortened URLs and user accounts, and delete any URL or user account. They should also be able to monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the URL expiration functionality in the `services.py` file. Users should be able to set an expiration date/time for their shortened URLs, after which the URLs will no longer redirect. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that URL expiration is working correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, run all the tests written in the previous steps to ensure that all parts of the application are working correctly. If any tests fail, debug the corresponding part of the application and fix the issue. Once all tests pass, the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "Step 7: Implement the user account management functionality in the `views.py` file.
