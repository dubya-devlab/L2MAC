This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. This dictionary should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. At this stage, also set up the basic routes for the application such as the home page, sign up page, and login page. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the application runs correctly and the routes are set up properly.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating a sign-up form where users can register using their email and a password. Also, implement a login form where users can log in using their email and password. The user data should be stored in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the registration and login features work correctly. The tests should check that the user data is correctly stored in the database and that the user can log in with the correct credentials.", "Step 3: Implement the forgotten password recovery feature. This can be done by sending a password reset link to the user's email. Since this is a mock application, the password reset link can simply display a message saying that the password has been reset. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the password recovery feature works correctly. The tests should check that the password reset link is sent to the correct email and that the password is reset when the link is clicked.", "Step 4: Implement the user profile features. This includes allowing users to set a profile picture and a status message. The profile picture and status message should be stored in the user's data in the mock database. Also, implement privacy settings that control who can see the user's details or last seen status. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the user profile features work correctly. The tests should check that the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings are correctly stored in the database and displayed on the user's profile.", "Step 5: Implement the contact management features. This includes allowing users to block and unblock contacts. The blocked contacts should be stored in the user's data in the mock database. Also, implement features to create, edit, and manage groups. The groups should also be stored in the user's data in the mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the contact management features work correctly. The tests should check that the blocked contacts and groups are correctly stored in the database and displayed on the user's profile.", "Step 6: Implement the messaging features. This includes allowing users to send and receive real-time text messages, displaying message read receipts, encrypting messages for security, and allowing image sharing and emojis, GIFs, and stickers support. The messages should be stored in a separate mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the messaging features work correctly. The tests should check that the messages are correctly stored in the database, displayed in the chat, and that the read receipts, encryption, image sharing, and emojis, GIFs, and stickers support work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the group chat features. This includes allowing users to create group chats with a name and picture, add or remove participants, and set admin roles and permissions. The group chats should be stored in a separate mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the group chat features work correctly. The tests should check that the group chats are correctly stored in the database, displayed in the chat, and that the participants, admin roles, and permissions are correctly managed.", "Step 8: Implement the status/story feature. This includes allowing users to post image statuses visible for a limited time and control who can see the status. The statuses should be stored in a separate mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the status/story feature works correctly. The tests should check that the statuses are correctly stored in the database, displayed on the user's profile, and that the visibility settings work correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the web application feature. This includes making the chat application accessible from browsers. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the web application feature works correctly. The tests should check that the application is correctly displayed in the browser and that all the features work correctly in the browser.", "Step 10: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes queuing messages for when the user is offline and displaying the online/offline status. The queued messages should be stored in a separate mock database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features work correctly. The tests should check that the messages are correctly queued when the user is offline and sent when the user is online, and that the online/offline status is correctly displayed."], "step": "Step 5: Implement the contact management features.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
