This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The database should have tables for users, messages, groups, and statuses. Each table should be a dictionary where the key is the unique identifier for the record (e.g., user ID, message ID, etc.) and the value is another dictionary representing the record. Write tests to ensure that the basic structure of the application and the mock database are set up correctly.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept an email and password, create a new user in the database, and return a success message. The forgotten password recovery route should accept an email, generate a temporary password, update the user's password in the database, and return the temporary password. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication routes work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept a user ID and the new picture or message, update the user's record in the database, and return a success message. The privacy settings route should accept a user ID and the new settings, update the user's record in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the profile management routes work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept two user IDs (the blocker and the blockee), update the blocker's record in the database, and return a success message. The group routes should accept a group ID and the new group data, update the group's record in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the contact management routes work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, for updating read receipts, and for sharing images. The send and receive routes should accept a message ID and the message data, create a new message in the database, and return a success message. The read receipt route should accept a message ID, update the message's record in the database, and return a success message. The image sharing route should accept a message ID and the image data, create a new message in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the messaging routes work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating groups, for adding and removing participants, and for managing admin roles and permissions. The create group route should accept a group ID and the group data, create a new group in the database, and return a success message. The add and remove participants routes should accept a group ID and a user ID, update the group's record in the database, and return a success message. The admin roles and permissions route should accept a group ID and the new roles and permissions, update the group's record in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the group chat routes work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting statuses and for managing who can see the status. The post status route should accept a user ID and the status data, create a new status in the database, and return a success message. The status visibility route should accept a user ID and the new visibility settings, update the user's record in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the status/story routes work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a route for serving the web application, and creating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the web application. The web application should use AJAX to interact with the Flask routes. Write tests to ensure that the web application route works as expected, and manually test the web application in a browser.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a route for updating the online/offline status of a user, and for queuing messages when the user is offline. The online/offline status route should accept a user ID and the new status, update the user's record in the database, and return a success message. The message queuing route should accept a message ID and the message data, create a new message in the database with a status of 'queued', and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode routes work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application.
