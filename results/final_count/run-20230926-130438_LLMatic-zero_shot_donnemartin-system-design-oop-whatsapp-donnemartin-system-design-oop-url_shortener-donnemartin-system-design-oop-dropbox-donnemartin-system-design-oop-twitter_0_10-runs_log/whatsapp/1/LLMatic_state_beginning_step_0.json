Create a new Python Flask application with the following files: `app.py` (the main application file), `models.py` (for the data models), `views.py` (for the routes and views), `forms.py` (for the form classes), and `utils.py` (for utility functions). Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. In the `models.py` file, define a User model with fields for email, password, and other necessary details. In the `views.py` file, create routes for user registration and login. Use Flask's session management to handle user sessions. Write tests to ensure that user registration, login, and session management are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. Add fields to the User model for profile picture and status message. Create routes in `views.py` for users to update their profile picture and status message. Write tests to ensure that users can update their profile details and that these updates are reflected in the User model.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. Define a Contact model in `models.py` with fields for the user's contacts and blocked contacts. Create routes in `views.py` for users to add, remove, and block contacts. Write tests to ensure that users can manage their contacts and that these changes are reflected in the Contact model.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. Define a Message model in `models.py` with fields for the sender, recipient, message content, read receipt, and timestamp. Create routes in `views.py` for users to send and receive messages. Write tests to ensure that users can send messages and that these messages are stored in the Message model.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. Define a Group model in `models.py` with fields for the group name, picture, participants, and admin roles. Create routes in `views.py` for users to create, join, and manage groups. Write tests to ensure that users can create and manage groups and that these groups are stored in the Group model.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. Define a Status model in `models.py` with fields for the user, image, visibility, and timestamp. Create routes in `views.py` for users to post and view statuses. Write tests to ensure that users can post statuses and that these statuses are stored in the Status model.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. Use Flask's template engine to create HTML templates for the various views. Create routes in `views.py` to render these templates. Write tests to ensure that the web application is rendering the correct templates.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. In the Message model, add a field for the message status (sent, delivered, read). Create a utility function in `utils.py` to queue messages when the user is offline and send them when the user is online. Write tests to ensure that messages are queued and sent correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire application to ensure that all features have been implemented correctly. Run all tests to ensure that they all pass. If any tests fail, debug the application to identify and fix the issues.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
