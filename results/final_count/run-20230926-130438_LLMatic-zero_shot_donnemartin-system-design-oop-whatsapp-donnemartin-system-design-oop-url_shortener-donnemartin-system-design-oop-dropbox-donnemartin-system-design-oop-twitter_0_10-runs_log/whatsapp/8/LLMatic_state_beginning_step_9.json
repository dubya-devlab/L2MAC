This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The database should have tables for users, messages, groups, and statuses. Each table should have appropriate fields according to the requirements. For example, the users table should have fields for email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, and blocked contacts. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database can store and retrieve data correctly.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept an email and password, and store the user in the database. The forgotten password recovery route should accept an email, generate a temporary password, and send it to the user's email. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that users can sign up and recover their passwords correctly.", "Step 3: Implement user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept a user id and the new picture or message, and update the user's data in the database. The privacy settings route should accept a user id and the new settings, and update the user's data in the database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that users can update their profile pictures, status messages, and privacy settings correctly.", "Step 4: Implement contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept a user id and a contact id, and update the user's blocked contacts in the database. The group routes should accept a user id and group details, and update the groups table in the database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that users can block and unblock contacts, and create, edit, and manage groups correctly.", "Step 5: Implement messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. The send and receive routes should accept a user id, a contact id or group id, and a message, and update the messages table in the database. The read receipt route should accept a user id and a message id, and update the message's read status in the database. The encryption route should accept a message, encrypt it, and return the encrypted message. The image sharing route should accept a user id, a contact id or group id, and an image, and update the messages table in the database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that users can send and receive messages, update read receipts, encrypt messages, and share images correctly.", "Step 6: Implement group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding and removing participants, and updating admin roles and permissions. The create group chat route should accept a user id, a group name, and a group picture, and update the groups table in the database. The add and remove participants routes should accept a group id and a user id, and update the group's participants in the database. The admin roles and permissions route should accept a group id, a user id, and the new roles and permissions, and update the group's data in the database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that users can create group chats, add and remove participants, and update admin roles and permissions correctly.", "Step 7: Implement status/story features. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and updating who can see the status. The post status route should accept a user id and an image, and update the statuses table in the database. The update visibility route should accept a user id, a status id, and the new visibility settings, and update the status's data in the database. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that users can post image statuses and update their visibility correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a web interface using Flask's templating engine. The web interface should have pages for sign up, sign in, profile, contacts, messages, groups, and statuses. Each page should display the relevant data from the database and allow the user to interact with the application. After implementing the web application, write tests to ensure that the web interface displays the correct data and allows the user to interact with the application correctly.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a message queue for when the user is offline, and displaying the user's online/offline status. The message queue should store messages that are sent when the user is offline, and send them when the user comes online. The online/offline status should be displayed on the user's profile page. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the message queue works correctly and that the online/offline status is displayed correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive test of the entire application. This includes testing all routes, all database operations, and all aspects of the web interface. Fix any bugs that are found, and make any necessary improvements to the code. After testing the application, write a final test report detailing the results of the tests and any bugs or improvements that were made."], "step": "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive test of the entire application.
