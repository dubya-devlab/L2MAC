This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The dictionary should have keys for 'users', 'groups', 'messages', and 'statuses'. Each key should map to another dictionary where the keys are unique identifiers and the values are the respective objects (User, Group, Message, Status). Write tests to ensure that the application setup is correct and the mock database is functioning as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the User Registration and Authentication features. This includes creating a User class with attributes for email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, and blocked contacts. The User class should also have methods for signing up, recovering a forgotten password, setting a profile picture, setting a status message, changing privacy settings, and blocking/unblocking contacts. Write tests to ensure that the User class and its methods are functioning as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the Contact Management features. This includes creating a Group class with attributes for name, picture, participants, and admins. The Group class should also have methods for creating a group, editing a group, adding/removing participants, and assigning/removing admin roles. Write tests to ensure that the Group class and its methods are functioning as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the Messaging features. This includes creating a Message class with attributes for sender, receiver, content, read receipt, encryption, and type (text, image, emoji, GIF, sticker). The Message class should also have methods for sending a message, receiving a message, marking a message as read, encrypting/decrypting a message, and sharing an image. Write tests to ensure that the Message class and its methods are functioning as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the Group Chats features. This includes modifying the Group class to allow for group chats. The Group class should have additional methods for sending a message to the group, receiving a message from the group, and managing group participants. Write tests to ensure that the Group class and its group chat methods are functioning as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the Status/Story Feature. This includes creating a Status class with attributes for user, content, visibility, and time limit. The Status class should also have methods for posting a status, viewing a status, and controlling who can see the status. Write tests to ensure that the Status class and its methods are functioning as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the Web Application feature. This includes creating a web interface using Flask that allows users to interact with the application. The web interface should have pages for sign up, sign in, profile management, contact management, messaging, group chats, and status/story. Write tests to ensure that the web interface and its pages are functioning as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the Connectivity and Offline Mode features. This includes modifying the User and Message classes to handle offline mode. The User class should have an additional attribute for online status and the Message class should have an additional method for queuing messages when the user is offline. Write tests to ensure that the User and Message classes and their offline mode methods are functioning as expected.", "Step 9: Integrate all the features together. This includes ensuring that the User, Group, Message, and Status classes work together to provide the full functionality of the application. Write tests to ensure that the integration of the features is functioning as expected.", "Step 10: Perform a final review of the application. This includes checking that all features have been implemented correctly, all tests pass, and the application runs smoothly. If any issues are found, debug and fix them. Write tests to ensure that the final application is functioning as expected."], "step": "Step 4: Implement the Messaging features.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
