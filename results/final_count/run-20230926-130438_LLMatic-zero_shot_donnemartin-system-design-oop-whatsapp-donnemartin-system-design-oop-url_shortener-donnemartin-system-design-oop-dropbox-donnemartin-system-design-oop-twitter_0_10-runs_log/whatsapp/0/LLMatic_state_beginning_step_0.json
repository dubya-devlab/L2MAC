This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The database should have tables for users, messages, groups, and statuses. Each table should be a dictionary where the key is the unique identifier for the record (e.g., user ID, message ID, etc.) and the value is another dictionary containing the record's data. Write tests to ensure that the database can correctly store and retrieve data.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating endpoints for user sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up endpoint should accept an email and password, create a new user record in the database, and return a success message. The forgotten password recovery endpoint should accept an email, generate a temporary password, update the user record in the database, and return the temporary password. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating endpoints for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message endpoints should accept a user ID and the new picture or message, update the user record in the database, and return a success message. The privacy settings endpoint should accept a user ID and the new settings, update the user record in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating endpoints for blocking/unblocking contacts and managing groups. The block/unblock endpoints should accept a user ID and the contact's user ID, update the user record in the database, and return a success message. The group management endpoints should allow for creating, editing, and deleting groups. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating endpoints for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. The send message endpoint should accept a sender ID, receiver ID, and message, create a new message record in the database, and return a success message. The receive message endpoint should accept a user ID, retrieve all unread messages for the user from the database, mark them as read, and return the messages. The read receipt endpoint should accept a message ID, update the message record in the database, and return a success message. The encryption endpoint should accept a message, encrypt it, and return the encrypted message. The image sharing endpoint should accept a sender ID, receiver ID, and image, create a new message record in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement group chats. This includes creating endpoints for creating groups, adding/removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The create group endpoint should accept a name, picture, and list of user IDs, create a new group record in the database, and return a success message. The add/remove participants endpoint should accept a group ID and user ID, update the group record in the database, and return a success message. The admin roles and permissions endpoint should accept a group ID, user ID, and new role/permissions, update the group record in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating endpoints for posting statuses and managing who can see them. The post status endpoint should accept a user ID and image, create a new status record in the database, and return a success message. The manage viewers endpoint should accept a status ID and list of user IDs, update the status record in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the endpoints work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a static folder for serving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and setting up Flask to serve these files. The main HTML file should include a form for user sign up, a form for user login, a form for sending messages, a list for displaying received messages, and a form for posting statuses. Write tests to ensure that the web application works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a queue for storing messages when the user is offline, and creating an endpoint for updating the user's online/offline status. The queue should be a list where each item is a dictionary containing the sender ID, receiver ID, and message. The update status endpoint should accept a user ID and status, update the user record in the database, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the queue and endpoint work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire application to ensure that all requirements have been met. Run all tests to ensure that they all pass. If any tests fail, debug the corresponding code and fix any issues.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
