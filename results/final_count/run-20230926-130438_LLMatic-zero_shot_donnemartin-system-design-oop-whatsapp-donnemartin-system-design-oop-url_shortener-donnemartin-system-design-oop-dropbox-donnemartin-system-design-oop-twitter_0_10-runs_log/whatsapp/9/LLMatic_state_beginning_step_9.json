This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The keys of this dictionary will be the user's email and the values will be another dictionary containing the user's password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is functioning as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for signing up and forgotten password recovery. For signing up, the route should accept a POST request with the user's email and password, and add this information to the 'users' dictionary. For password recovery, the route should accept a POST request with the user's email and return the corresponding password from the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. These routes should accept POST requests with the user's email and the new profile picture, status message, or privacy settings, and update the corresponding values in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. These routes should accept POST requests with the user's email and the contact's email or the group details, and update the corresponding values in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving text messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, sharing images, and supporting emojis, GIFs, and stickers. These routes should accept POST requests with the sender's email, the recipient's email, and the message details, and update the corresponding values in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding or removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. These routes should accept POST requests with the user's email and the group details, and update the corresponding values in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and controlling who can see the status. These routes should accept POST requests with the user's email and the status details, and update the corresponding values in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a route for accessing the application from a browser. This route should return a HTML page with the application's user interface. Write tests to ensure that this route is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a route for updating the user's online/offline status, and a mechanism for queuing messages when the user is offline. The route should accept a POST request with the user's email and the new status, and update the corresponding value in the 'users' dictionary. The queuing mechanism should store messages in a separate dictionary when the recipient is offline, and send them when the recipient comes online. Write tests to ensure that this route and mechanism are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire application and make any necessary adjustments. This includes checking that all routes are working correctly, that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected, and that all features are implemented according to the requirements.
