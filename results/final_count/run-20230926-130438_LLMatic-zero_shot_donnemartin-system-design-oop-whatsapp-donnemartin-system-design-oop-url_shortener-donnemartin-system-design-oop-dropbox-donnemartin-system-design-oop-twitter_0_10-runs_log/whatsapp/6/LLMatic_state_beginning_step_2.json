The tests should check that a user can create group chats, add or remove participants, and manage admin roles, and that these updates are reflected in the database.", "7. Implement the status/story feature. This includes functions to post image statuses, and to control who can see the status. The post status function should take a user ID, an image file, and a visibility setting, and add the status to the database. The control visibility function should take a user ID, a status ID, and a visibility setting, and update the status's visibility in the database.

The tests should check that the server is running, and that the routes return the expected responses.", "9. Implement the connectivity and offline mode. This includes functions to queue messages when the user is offline, and to display the user's online/offline status. The queue message function should take a sender ID, a receiver ID, and a message, and add the message to a queue in the database. The display status function should take a user ID and return the user's online/offline status from the database. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work correctly. The tests should check that messages are queued when the user is offline, and that the user's online/offline status is correctly displayed.", "10. Finally, review the entire codebase to ensure that all functions are implemented correctly and that all tests pass. If any tests fail, debug the corresponding functions and rerun the tests until all tests pass. Once all tests pass, the implementation of the Global Chat Service is complete."], "step": "3.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
