{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "\nObjective: Write code for a large system design task.\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.\nOnly use the functions you have been provided with.\nOnly use the `write_files` to output code.\n\nYou must act autonomously and you will receive no human input at any stage. You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}], "file_dict": {"app.py": ["from flask import Flask, request", "from user import

Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. This includes the main application file (app.py), a file for user management (user.py), a file for message management (message.py), a file for group management (group.py), and a file for status management (status.py). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up and all files are in their correct locations.", "2. Implement the user registration and authentication system. This includes the sign up function, which should take an email and password, and the forgotten password recovery function. The sign up function should check if the email is already in use, and if not, add the new user to the database. The forgotten password recovery function should send a recovery email to the user's email address. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work correctly. The tests should check that a user can sign up with a new email, that a user cannot sign up with an email that is already in use, and that a recovery email is sent when the forgotten password recovery function is called.", "3. Implement the user profile management system. This includes functions to set a profile picture and status message, and to set privacy settings. The set profile picture function should take a user ID and an image file, and update the user's profile picture in the database. The set status message function should take a user ID and a status message, and update the user's status message in the database. The set privacy settings function should take a user ID and a privacy setting, and update the user's privacy setting in the database. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work correctly. The tests should check that a user's profile picture, status message, and privacy setting can be updated, and that these updates are reflected in the database.", "4. Implement the contact management system. This includes functions to block and unblock contacts, and to create, edit, and manage groups. The block contact function should take a user ID and a contact ID, and add the contact to the user's blocked contacts list in the database. The unblock contact function should take a user ID and a contact ID, and remove the contact from the user's blocked contacts list in the database. The create group function should take a user ID, a group name, and a list of member IDs, and create a new group in the database. The edit group function should take a group ID, a new group name, and a new list of member IDs, and update the group in the database. The manage groups function should take a user ID and return a list of the user's groups from the database. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work correctly. The tests should check that a user can block and unblock contacts, and that these updates are reflected in the database. The tests should also check that a user can create, edit, and manage groups, and that these updates are reflected in the database.", "5. Implement the messaging system. This includes functions to send and receive real-time text messages, to send read receipts, to encrypt messages, and to share images. The send message function should take a sender ID, a receiver ID, and a message, and add the message to the database. The receive message function should take a receiver ID and return the latest message for the receiver from the database. The send read receipt function should take a sender ID, a receiver ID, and a message ID, and update the message's read status in the database. The encrypt message function should take a message and return the encrypted message. The share image function should take a sender ID, a receiver ID, and an image file, and add the image to the database. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work correctly. The tests should check that a user can send and receive messages, that read receipts are sent and received, that messages are encrypted, and that images can be shared, and that these updates are reflected in the database.", "6. Implement the group chat system. This includes functions to create group chats, to add or remove participants, and to manage admin roles and permissions. The create group chat function should take a user ID, a group name, and a list of member IDs, and create a new group chat in the database. The add participant function should take a group chat ID and a participant ID, and add the participant to the group chat in the database. The remove participant function should take a group chat ID and a participant ID, and remove the participant from the group chat in the database. The manage admin roles function should take a group chat ID, a user ID, and a role, and update the user's role in the group chat in the database. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work correctly. The tests should check that a user can create group chats, add or remove participants, and manage admin roles, and that these updates are reflected in the database.", "7. Implement the status/story feature. This includes functions to post image statuses, and to control who can see the status. The post status function should take a user ID, an image file, and a visibility setting, and add the status to the database. The control visibility function should take a user ID, a status ID, and a visibility setting, and update the status's visibility in the database. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work correctly. The tests should check that a user can post image statuses, control who can see the status, and that these updates are reflected in the database.", "8. Implement the web application. This includes setting up a Flask server, and creating routes for the different functions. The routes should include routes for signing up, logging in, managing user profiles, managing contacts, sending and receiving messages, managing group chats, and managing statuses.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
