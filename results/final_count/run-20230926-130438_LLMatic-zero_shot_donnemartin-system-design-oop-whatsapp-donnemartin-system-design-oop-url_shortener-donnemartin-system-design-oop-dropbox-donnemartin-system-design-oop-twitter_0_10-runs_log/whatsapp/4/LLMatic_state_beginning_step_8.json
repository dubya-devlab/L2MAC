This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The database should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. Write tests to ensure that the database can correctly store and retrieve user data.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for user sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept user email and password, and store them in the database. The forgotten password recovery route should allow users to reset their password using their email. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication system works correctly.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept the respective data and update the user's profile in the database. The privacy settings route should accept the new settings and update them in the database. Write tests to ensure that the profile management system works correctly.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept the contact's email and update the user's block list in the database. The group management routes should allow users to create new groups, add or remove members, and update group details. Write tests to ensure that the contact management system works correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging system. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. The send and receive routes should accept the message data and update the conversation in the database. The read receipt route should accept the message ID and update the message's read status in the database. The encryption route should encrypt the message before storing it in the database. The image sharing route should accept the image data and update the conversation in the database. Write tests to ensure that the messaging system works correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat system. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding or removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The create group chat route should accept the group details and create a new group in the database. The add or remove participants route should accept the participant's email and update the group's member list in the database. The admin management route should allow admins to assign or revoke admin roles and permissions. Write tests to ensure that the group chat system works correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and managing who can see the status. The post status route should accept the image data and update the user's status in the database. The status visibility route should accept the visibility settings and update them in the database. Write tests to ensure that the status/story feature works correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend that interacts with the Flask backend. The frontend should include forms for user registration, login, profile management, contact management, messaging, group chat management, and status posting. Write tests to ensure that the frontend can correctly interact with the backend.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a system for queuing messages when the user is offline and sending them once connectivity is restored. Also, create a system for displaying the user's online/offline status. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode system works correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive test of the entire application.

Once all tests pass, the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode.
