The Notification dataclass should also include a method for notifying users of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that notifications are working correctly.", "9. **Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending and discovery functionality. This includes creating a TrendingTopic dataclass with fields for the topic's name and related posts, and methods for identifying and displaying trending topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. The TrendingTopic dataclass should also include a method for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that trending and discovery are working correctly.", "10. **Final Testing & Deployment:** After implementing all the functionalities, perform a final round of testing to ensure that all parts of the application are working together correctly.

You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output.
