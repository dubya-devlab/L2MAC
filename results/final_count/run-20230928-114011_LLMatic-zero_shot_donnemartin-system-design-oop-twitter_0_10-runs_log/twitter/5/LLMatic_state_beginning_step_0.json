Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up and that all dependencies are installed.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication functionality. This includes creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password, and methods for registering a new user and authenticating an existing user. Use JWT for secure authentication. The User dataclass should also include a method for resetting a forgotten password. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that user registration, authentication, and password reset are working correctly.", "3. **User Profile Management:** Implement the user profile management functionality. This includes creating a UserProfile dataclass with fields for profile picture, bio, website link, and location, and methods for editing these fields. The UserProfile dataclass should also include a method for toggling the profile's privacy setting. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that user profile management is working correctly.", "4. **Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting and content management functionality. This includes creating a Post dataclass with fields for the post's text content, images, and author, and methods for creating and deleting posts. The Post dataclass should also include methods for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts, as well as a method for searching for specific posts or users using keywords. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that posting and content management are working correctly.", "5. **Interacting with Posts:** Implement the functionality for interacting with posts. This includes creating a Comment dataclass with fields for the comment's text content, author, and parent post, and methods for creating and deleting comments. The Comment dataclass should also include a method for liking comments. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that interacting with posts is working correctly.", "6. **Social Interaction:** Implement the social interaction functionality. This includes creating a Follow dataclass with fields for the follower and the followed user, and methods for following and unfollowing users. The Follow dataclass should also include a method for displaying a timeline view of posts from followed users. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that social interaction is working correctly.", "7. **Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging functionality. This includes creating a Message dataclass with fields for the message's text content, sender, and recipient, and methods for sending and deleting messages. The Message dataclass should also include a method for blocking and unblocking users from messaging. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that direct messaging is working correctly.", "8. **Notifications:** Implement the notifications functionality. This includes creating a Notification dataclass with fields for the notification's content, recipient, and related post or user, and methods for creating and deleting notifications. The Notification dataclass should also include a method for notifying users of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that notifications are working correctly.", "9. **Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending and discovery functionality. This includes creating a TrendingTopic dataclass with fields for the topic's name and related posts, and methods for identifying and displaying trending topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. The TrendingTopic dataclass should also include a method for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that trending and discovery are working correctly.", "10. **Final Testing & Deployment:** After implementing all the functionalities, perform a final round of testing to ensure that all parts of the application are working together correctly. This includes testing the integration of the different dataclasses and their methods, as well as the overall user experience of the application.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
