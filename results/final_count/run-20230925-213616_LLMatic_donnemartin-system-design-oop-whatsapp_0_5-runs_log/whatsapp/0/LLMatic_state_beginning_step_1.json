Write a simple test in the test file to ensure that the project setup is correct. Run the test to verify.", "2. Implement the user registration and authentication system. Create a new file, auth.py, and define a User dataclass with fields for email, password, and other necessary information. Implement a function for user registration that takes in an email and password, creates a new User instance, and stores it in an in-memory dictionary. Also, implement a function for password recovery that takes in an email, checks if a User with that email exists, and returns the User's password if it does.

In the messages.py file, add a field to the Message dataclass for the group chat's name. Implement a function for creating group chats that takes in a name and a list of participant emails, and creates a new group chat. Also, implement functions for adding or removing participants, and setting admin roles and permissions. Write tests for these functions and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "7. Implement the status/story feature. Create a new file, status.py, and define a Status dataclass with fields for the user's email, the status content, and the visibility settings. Implement a function for posting statuses that takes in a user's email, a status, and visibility settings, creates a new Status instance, and stores it in an in-memory dictionary. Write tests for this function and run them to ensure it works correctly.", "8. Implement the web application. In the app.py file, define routes for the various features of the application, such as user registration, messaging, and posting statuses. Use the Flask framework to handle HTTP requests and responses. Write tests for these routes and run them to ensure they work correctly.", "9. Implement the connectivity and offline mode. In the messages.py file, add a field to the Message dataclass for the message's queued status. Implement a function for queuing messages that takes in a Message instance and sets its queued status to True if the recipient is offline.

Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
