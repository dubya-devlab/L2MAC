Create a new directory for the project and initialize it as a Python project. Create a requirements.txt file and add the necessary dependencies such as Flask, pytest, and dataclasses. Also, create a main.py file which will serve as the entry point for the application. This file will contain the main Flask application and the routes for the different functionalities. Write a test to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and that the necessary dependencies are installed.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication system. This will involve creating a User class with attributes such as email and password. The User class should also have methods for signing up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up method should take in an email and password, create a new User instance, and store it in an in-memory dictionary that acts as our database. The forgotten password recovery method should take in an email, check if a User with that email exists in the database, and if so, return a message indicating that a password recovery email has been sent. Write tests to ensure that the User class and its methods work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile feature. This will involve adding additional attributes to the User class such as profile picture and status message. It will also involve creating methods for setting these attributes and privacy settings. The privacy settings should determine who can see the user's details or last seen status. Write tests to ensure that the user profile feature works as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management feature. This will involve creating a Contact class with attributes such as name and blocked status. The User class should have a list of Contacts and methods for blocking and unblocking contacts. It should also have methods for creating, editing, and managing groups. Write tests to ensure that the contact management feature works as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging feature. This will involve creating a Message class with attributes such as sender, receiver, content, read status, and encryption status. The User class should have a list of Messages and methods for sending and receiving messages. It should also have methods for sending images, emojis, GIFs, and stickers. Write tests to ensure that the messaging feature works as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat feature. This will involve creating a Group class with attributes such as name, picture, participants, and admin roles. The User class should have a list of Groups and methods for creating groups, adding or removing participants, and managing admin roles. Write tests to ensure that the group chat feature works as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This will involve adding a Status class with attributes such as content, visibility duration, and visibility settings. The User class should have a list of Statuses and methods for posting and viewing statuses. Write tests to ensure that the status/story feature works as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This will involve setting up Flask routes for the different functionalities and rendering appropriate templates. Write tests to ensure that the web application feature works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode feature. This will involve adding an online status attribute to the User class and a queue for storing messages when the user is offline. The User class should have methods for toggling the online status and sending queued messages when the user comes online. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode feature works as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire codebase to ensure that everything is working as expected. Run all the tests to ensure that they all pass. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues. Once all tests pass, the implementation of the Global Chat Service is complete."], "step": "Step 3: Implement the user profile feature.
