This class should have attributes for `email`, `password`, `last_seen`, `profile_picture`, `status_message`, and `privacy_settings`. The `User` class should also have methods for `sign_up`, `recover_password`, `set_profile_picture`, `set_status_message`, and `set_privacy_settings`. The `sign_up` method should add the user to a mock database (a dictionary). The `recover_password` method should return the user's password. The `set_profile_picture`, `set_status_message`, and `set_privacy_settings` methods should update the respective attributes. After implementing the `User` class, write a test file named `test_user.py` to test all the methods of the `User` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "2. **Contact Management**: Create a `Contact` class in a file named `contact.py`. This class should have attributes for `user` (an instance of the `User` class), `blocked_contacts` (a list of `User` instances), and `groups` (a list of `Group` instances). The `Contact` class should also have methods for `block_contact`, `unblock_contact`, `create_group`, `edit_group`, and `manage_group`. The `block_contact` and `unblock_contact` methods should add and remove users from the `blocked_contacts` list respectively. The `create_group`, `edit_group`, and `manage_group` methods should perform the respective operations on the `groups` list. After implementing the `Contact` class, write a test file named `test_contact.py` to test all the methods of the `Contact` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "3. **Messaging**: Create a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender` (an instance of the `User` class), `receiver` (an instance of the `User` class), `content`, `read_receipt`, `encryption`, and `attachments`. The `Message` class should also have methods for `send`, `receive`, `encrypt`, `decrypt`, and `attach`. The `send` method should add the message to a mock database (a dictionary). The `receive` method should retrieve the message from the mock database. The `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods should perform simple encryption and decryption on the `content` attribute. The `attach` method should add attachments to the `attachments` list. After implementing the `Message` class, write a test file named `test_message.py` to test all the methods of the `Message` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "4. **Group Chats**: Create a `Group` class in a file named `group.py`. This class should have attributes for `name`, `picture`, `participants` (a list of `User` instances), and `admin` (an instance of the `User` class). The `Group` class should also have methods for `add_participant`, `remove_participant`, `set_admin`, and `send_message`. The `add_participant` and `remove_participant` methods should add and remove users from the `participants` list respectively. The `set_admin` method should set the `admin` attribute. The `send_message` method should create an instance of the `Message` class and add it to a mock database (a dictionary). After implementing the `Group` class, write a test file named `test_group.py` to test all the methods of the `Group` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "5. **Status/Story Feature**: Create a `Status` class in a file named `status.py`. This class should have attributes for `user` (an instance of the `User` class), `content`, `visibility`, and `expiry`. The `Status` class should also have methods for `post` and `view`. The `post` method should add the status to a mock database (a dictionary). The `view` method should retrieve the status from the mock database. After implementing the `Status` class, write a test file named `test_status.py` to test all the methods of the `Status` class. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "6. **Web Application**: Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This application should have routes for sign up, sign in, recover password, view profile, edit profile, block contact, unblock contact, create group, edit group, manage group, send message, receive message, create status, and view status. Each route should use the respective method from the `User`, `Contact`, `Message`, `Group`, and `Status` classes. After implementing the Flask application, write a test file named `test_app.py` to test all the routes of the application. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.", "7. **Connectivity and Offline Mode**: Implement a `connectivity` function in a file named `connectivity.py`. This function should simulate connectivity by randomly returning True or False. Modify the `send` method of the `Message` class and the `post` method of the `Status` class to use the `connectivity` function. If the `connectivity` function returns True, the message or status should be added to the mock database. If the `connectivity` function returns False, the message or status should be added to a queue. Implement a `restore_connectivity` function that empties the queue and adds the messages and statuses to the mock database when the `connectivity` function returns True. After implementing the `connectivity` and `restore_connectivity` functions, write a test file named `test_connectivity.py` to test these functions. Run the tests to ensure they all pass."], "step": "5. **Status/Story Feature**: Create a `Status` class in a file named `status.py`.

The `post` method should add the status to a mock database (a dictionary). The `view` method should retrieve the status from the mock database.

When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persis between steps or write operations.\n\nUse the functions provided.

Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass. Please be sure to include all of the specified feature requirements in the following plan.\n"}], "message_hash": "b157aecd598dba5a9683257d0d703fa407ba17b604f63395e8121ad10d07c2ae"}
