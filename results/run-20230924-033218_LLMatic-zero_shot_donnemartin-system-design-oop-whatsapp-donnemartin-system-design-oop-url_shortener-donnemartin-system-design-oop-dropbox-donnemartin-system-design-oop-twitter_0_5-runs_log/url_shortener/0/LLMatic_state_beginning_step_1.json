Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and set up the necessary files and directories. The main files will include `app.py` (the main application file), `models.py` (for database models), `views.py` (for handling HTTP requests), `utils.py` (for utility functions), and `tests.py` (for unit tests). Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up and run the test.", "2. Implement the `models.py` file. This file will contain the data models for the application. We will need a `User` model to represent users, a `URL` model to represent URLs, and a `Click` model to represent clicks on URLs. Each model will be a Python class with attributes representing the fields of the model. The `User` model will have fields like `id`, `username`, `password`, and `urls` (a list of URLs associated with the user). The `URL` model will have fields like `id`, `original_url`, `shortened_url`, `user_id` (the ID of the user who created the URL), `clicks` (a list of clicks on the URL), and `expiration_date`. The `Click` model will have fields like `id`, `url_id` (the ID of the URL that was clicked), `click_time`, and `click_location`. After implementing the models, write a test to ensure that the models are correctly implemented and run the test.", "3. Implement the `utils.py` file. This file will contain utility functions for the application. We will need functions to validate URLs, generate shortened URLs, and gather click data. The `validate_url` function will take a URL as input and return a boolean indicating whether the URL is valid. The `generate_shortened_url` function will take a URL and an optional custom short link as input and return a shortened URL. The `gather_click_data` function will take a click event as input and return a `Click` object with the click time and location. After implementing the utility functions, write a test to ensure that the utility functions are correctly implemented and run the test.", "4. Implement the `views.py` file. This file will handle HTTP requests to the application. We will need views to handle user registration, user login, URL shortening, URL redirection, URL editing, URL deletion, URL analytics viewing, and user account deletion. Each view will be a function that takes a request as input and returns a response. The views will use the models and utility functions to perform their tasks. After implementing the views, write a test to ensure that the views are correctly implemented and run the test.", "5. Implement the `app.py` file. This file will set up the Flask application and register the views. It will import the views from `views.py` and register them with the Flask application. After implementing the application setup, write a test to ensure that the application is correctly set up and run the test.", "6. Implement the `tests.py` file. This file will contain unit tests for the application. We will need tests for each model, each utility function, and each view. The tests will create mock data, call the function or method being tested, and assert that the expected results are returned. After implementing the tests, run them to ensure that all the tests pass.", "7. Implement the admin dashboard. This will be a view in `views.py` that is only accessible to users with admin privileges. The dashboard will display all URLs and user accounts, and allow the admin to delete any URL or user account. After implementing the admin dashboard, write a test to ensure that the dashboard is correctly implemented and run the test.", "8. Implement the URL expiration feature. This will involve adding an `expiration_date` field to the `URL` model, and checking this field in the URL redirection view. If the current date is later than the `expiration_date`, the view will return an error instead of redirecting to the original URL. After implementing the URL expiration feature, write a test to ensure that the feature is correctly implemented and run the test.", "9. Finally, review the entire application to ensure that all requirements have been met. Run all tests again to ensure that they all pass. If any requirements are missing or any tests fail, go back to the relevant step and fix the issue. Once all requirements are met and all tests pass, the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "2. Implement the `models.py` file. This file will contain the data models for the application.
