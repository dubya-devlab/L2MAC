Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and set up the necessary files and directories. The project structure should include the following files and directories: main.py (the entry point of the application), models.py (for database models), views.py (for handling HTTP requests), services.py (for business logic), tests/ (a directory for test files), and requirements.txt (for project dependencies). Write a basic Flask application in main.py and set up the routes for the application in views.py. Also, set up a mock database in models.py using a dictionary to store data. Make sure to include all necessary imports in each file. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the routes are working as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. In models.py, define a URL model with fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, and the user who created it. In services.py, write a function to generate a unique shortened URL. This function should take a URL as input, validate that the URL is active and legitimate, and return a unique shortened URL. In views.py, set up a route to handle POST requests to a '/shorten' endpoint. This route should call the URL shortening function and return the shortened URL in the response. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening function is working correctly and that the '/shorten' route is returning the correct response. Run these tests using pytest.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. In views.py, set up a route to handle GET requests to a '/:short_url' endpoint. This route should look up the original URL associated with the short URL in the URL model and redirect the user to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection is working correctly and that the '/:short_url' route is returning the correct response. Run these tests using pytest.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. In models.py, define a Click model with fields for the URL that was clicked, the date/time of the click, and the geographical location of the clicker. In services.py, write a function to record a click. This function should take a URL as input, record a click in the Click model, and return the updated click count for the URL. In views.py, set up a route to handle GET requests to a '/:short_url/stats' endpoint. This route should call the click recording function and return the click count in the response. Write tests to ensure that the click recording function is working correctly and that the '/:short_url/stats' route is returning the correct response. Run these tests using pytest.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. In models.py, define a User model with fields for the user's username and password. In services.py, write functions to create a user, authenticate a user, and get a user's URLs. In views.py, set up routes to handle POST requests to a '/register' endpoint (for user registration), POST requests to a '/login' endpoint (for user authentication), and GET requests to a '/user/urls' endpoint (for getting a user's URLs). Write tests to ensure that the user functions are working correctly and that the user routes are returning the correct responses. Run these tests using pytest.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. In services.py, write functions to get all URLs, delete a URL, get all users, and delete a user. In views.py, set up routes to handle GET requests to a '/admin/urls' endpoint (for getting all URLs), DELETE requests to a '/admin/urls/:short_url' endpoint (for deleting a URL), GET requests to a '/admin/users' endpoint (for getting all users), and DELETE requests to a '/admin/users/:username' endpoint (for deleting a user). Write tests to ensure that the admin functions are working correctly and that the admin routes are returning the correct responses. Run these tests using pytest.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. In the URL model, add a field for the expiration date/time of the URL. In the URL shortening function, add an optional parameter for the expiration date/time. If this parameter is provided, set the expiration date/time of the URL in the URL model. In the redirection route, check if the URL has expired before redirecting the user. If the URL has expired, return an error response. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature is working correctly. Run these tests using pytest.", "8.
