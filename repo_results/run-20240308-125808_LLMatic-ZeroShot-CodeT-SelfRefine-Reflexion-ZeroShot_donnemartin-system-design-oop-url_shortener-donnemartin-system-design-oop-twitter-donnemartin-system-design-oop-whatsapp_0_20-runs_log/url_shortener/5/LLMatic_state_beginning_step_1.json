The project will need a main file (main.py) to serve as the entry point for the application.

Each of these files will contain a class with the same name. The main file will import and use these classes to provide the functionality of the application. Create a requirements.txt file to list all the necessary packages for the project. Write tests for each of these files to ensure they are created correctly.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening service. This service will need a method to validate URLs, a method to generate unique shortened URLs, and a method to allow users to choose custom short links. The URL validation method should check if the URL is active and legitimate. The URL generation method should create a unique shortened URL. The custom short link method should allow users to choose a custom short link if it is available. Write tests to ensure these methods work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection functionality. This will involve creating a method in the URL shortening service that takes a shortened URL and redirects to the original URL. Write tests to ensure this method works as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics service. This service will need methods to track and retrieve statistics about shortened URLs. It should be able to track the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. Write tests to ensure these methods work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the user account management service. This service will need methods to allow users to create accounts, view all their shortened URLs, edit or delete their shortened URLs, and view analytics for all their shortened URLs. Write tests to ensure these methods work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard. This will involve creating a class in the admin_dashboard.py file. The class should have methods to allow administrators to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure these methods work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the expiration functionality. This will involve adding a method to the URL shortening service that allows users to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. Write tests to ensure this method works as expected.", "Step 8: Integrate all the services in the main file. The main file should import the URL shortening service, the user account management service, the admin dashboard, and the analytics service. It should provide an interface for users to interact with these services. Write tests to ensure the integration works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement a simple command line interface for the application in the main file. The interface should allow users to interact with the application, providing options to shorten URLs, view analytics, manage user accounts, and access the admin dashboard.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
