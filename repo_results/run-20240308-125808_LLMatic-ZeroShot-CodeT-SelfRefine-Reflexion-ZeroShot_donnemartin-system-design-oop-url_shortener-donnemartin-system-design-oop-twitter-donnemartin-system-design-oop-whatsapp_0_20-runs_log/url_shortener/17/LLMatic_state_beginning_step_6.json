Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and requests (for URL validation). Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain a function to generate a unique shortened URL. The function will take a URL as input and return a shortened version of it. The shortened URL can be generated by hashing the original URL and taking a substring of the hash. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly generates unique shortened URLs.", "Step 3: Implement the URL validation feature. In the `url_shortener.py` file, add a function to validate that a given URL is active and legitimate. The function can send a GET request to the URL and check the response status code. If the status code is 200, the URL is valid. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly validates URLs.", "Step 4: Implement the custom short link feature. Modify the URL shortening function to accept an optional parameter for a custom short link. If the parameter is provided, the function should use it as the shortened URL instead of generating a new one. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly handles custom short links.", "Step 5: Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that matches the pattern of the shortened URLs. When a GET request is made to this route, the application should redirect to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain functions to track and retrieve statistics about shortened URLs. The statistics can be stored in a dictionary, with the shortened URL as the key and a list of click data as the value. Each click data can be a dictionary containing the date/time and geographical location of the click. Write tests to ensure that the analytics functions work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain functions to handle user account operations such as creating an account, viewing all shortened URLs of a user, editing or deleting a shortened URL, and viewing analytics for all shortened URLs of a user. The user data can be stored in a dictionary, with the username as the key and a list of shortened URLs as the value. Write tests to ensure that the user account functions work correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In the `admin_dashboard.py` file, add functions to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functions work correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the expiration feature. Modify the URL shortening function to accept an optional parameter for an expiration date/time. If the parameter is provided, the function should store it along with the shortened URL. When a GET request is made to a shortened URL, the application should check the expiration date/time and return a 404 status code if the URL has expired. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature works correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, integrate all the features in the `app.py` file. Add routes for each feature and call the appropriate functions from the `url_shortener.py`, `analytics.py`, `user_accounts.py`, and `admin_dashboard.py` files. Write tests to ensure that all the features work together correctly and the application behaves as expected."], "step": "Step 7: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain functions to handle user account operations such as creating an account, viewing all shortened URLs of a user, editing or deleting a shortened URL, and viewing analytics for all shortened URLs of a user. The user data can be stored in a dictionary, with the username as the key and a list of shortened URLs as the value.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
