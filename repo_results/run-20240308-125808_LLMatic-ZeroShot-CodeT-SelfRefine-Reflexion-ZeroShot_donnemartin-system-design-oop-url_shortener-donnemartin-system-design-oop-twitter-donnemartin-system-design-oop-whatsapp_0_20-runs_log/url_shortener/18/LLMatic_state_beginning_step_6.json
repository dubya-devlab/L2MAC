Start by setting up the project structure and necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to manage the project dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and requests (for URL validation). Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain the logic for URL shortening. This should include a function to validate URLs, a function to generate unique shortened URLs, and a function to handle custom short links. The URL validation function should send a GET request to the URL and check the response status. The URL shortening function should generate a unique string of characters that will serve as the shortened URL. The custom short link function should check if the custom link is already in use and return an error if it is. Write tests for each of these functions to ensure they work as expected.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that will handle the redirection. This route should take the shortened URL as a parameter, look up the original URL in the in-memory database, and redirect the user to the original URL. Write a test to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain the logic for the analytics. This should include functions to track and retrieve the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. The geographical location can be determined using the IP address of the request. Write tests for each of these functions to ensure they work as expected.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain the logic for user accounts. This should include functions to create accounts, view all shortened URLs associated with an account, edit or delete shortened URLs, and view analytics for all shortened URLs. Write tests for each of these functions to ensure they work as expected.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `admin_dashboard.py` file that will contain the logic for the admin dashboard. This should include functions to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests for each of these functions to ensure they work as expected.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. Add a function in the `url_shortener.py` file to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. This function should check if the current date/time is past the expiration date/time and return an error if it is. Write a test to ensure that the expiration feature works correctly.", "8. Integrate all the features in the `app.py` file. Add routes for each feature and ensure that they work correctly together. Write tests to ensure that the integration is successful and all features work as expected.", "9. Perform a final round of testing. Run all the tests written in the previous steps to ensure that all features work as expected. Fix any issues that are found during testing.", "10. Finalize the project.

Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
