Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list all the necessary Python packages. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up.", "Step 2: Implement the mock database in 'database.py'. This will be an in-memory dictionary to store data. The database should have tables for users, shortened URLs, and analytics. Each table will be a dictionary where the key is the ID and the value is the data associated with that ID. Write tests to ensure that data can be correctly added, retrieved, updated, and deleted from the mock database.", "Step 3: Implement the user account management functionality in 'user.py'. This will include functions for creating a new user, retrieving a user's data, updating a user's data, and deleting a user. The user's data will include their username, password, and a list of their shortened URLs. Write tests to ensure that the user account management functionality works correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the URL shortening functionality in 'url_shortener.py'.

When a user accesses a shortened URL, they should be redirected to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection functionality works correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the analytics functionality in 'analytics.py'. This will include functions for recording a click when a shortened URL is accessed, retrieving the number of clicks for a shortened URL, and retrieving the date/time and geographical location of each click. Write tests to ensure that the analytics functionality works correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard functionality in 'admin.py'. This will include functions for retrieving all shortened URLs, deleting a URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functionality works correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the expiration functionality in 'url_shortener.py'. Users should be able to set an expiration date/time for their shortened URLs. When a shortened URL has expired, it should no longer redirect to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the expiration functionality works correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the Flask application in 'app.py'. This will include routes for the user to input a URL to be shortened, view their shortened URLs and their analytics, and access the admin dashboard. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application works correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, run all the tests to ensure that all the functionalities work correctly together.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
