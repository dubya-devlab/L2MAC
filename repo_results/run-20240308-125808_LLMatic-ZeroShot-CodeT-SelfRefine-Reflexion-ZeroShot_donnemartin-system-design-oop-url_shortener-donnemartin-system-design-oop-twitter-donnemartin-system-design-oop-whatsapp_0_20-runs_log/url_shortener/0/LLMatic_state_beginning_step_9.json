The packages will include Flask, pytest, and requests (for URL validation). Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain the logic for URL shortening. This will include a function to validate the URL, a function to generate a unique shortened URL, and a function to handle custom short links. The URL validation function should send a GET request to the URL and check the response status. The URL shortening function should generate a unique string of characters that will serve as the shortened URL. The custom short link function should check if the custom link is already in use and if not, assign it to the URL. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening functions work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that will handle the redirection. The route should take the shortened URL as a parameter, look it up in the in-memory database, and redirect to the original URL. Write a test to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain the logic for the analytics. This will include functions to record a click (including the date/time and geographical location), and to retrieve the analytics for a specific URL. The geographical location can be determined from the IP address of the request. Write tests to ensure that the analytics functions work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain the logic for user accounts. This will include functions to create an account, to view all shortened URLs associated with an account, and to edit or delete a shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that the user accounts functions work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `admin_dashboard.py` file that will contain the logic for the admin dashboard. This will include functions to view all shortened URLs, to delete any URL or user account, and to monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functions work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the expiration feature. Add a function in the `url_shortener.py` file to set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. The function should check the current date/time against the expiration date/time and if the current date/time is later, the URL should be deleted. Write a test to ensure that the expiration feature works correctly.", "Step 8: Integrate all the features in the `app.py` file. Add routes for each feature and ensure that they work correctly together. Write tests to ensure that the integration is successful.", "Step 9: Perform a final review of the code. Check for any errors or inconsistencies and fix them. Also, ensure that the code follows best practices for Python and Flask.", "Step 10: Run all the tests again to ensure that everything works as expected. If any test fails, debug the issue and fix it.
