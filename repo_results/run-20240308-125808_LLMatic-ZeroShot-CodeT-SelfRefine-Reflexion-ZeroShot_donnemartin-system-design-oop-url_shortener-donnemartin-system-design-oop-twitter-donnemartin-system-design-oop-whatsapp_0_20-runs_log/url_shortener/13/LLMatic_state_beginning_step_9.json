and the necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named 'app.py'. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask for the web framework, pytest for testing, and requests for making HTTP requests to validate URLs. At this stage, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a 'url_shortener.py' file that will contain a function to generate a unique shortened URL. The function will take a URL as input and return a shortened version of it. The shortened URL can be generated by hashing the original URL and taking a substring of the hash. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly generates unique shortened URLs.", "Step 3: Implement the URL validation feature. In the 'url_shortener.py' file, add a function to validate that a URL is active and legitimate. The function will make a HTTP request to the URL and check the response status. If the status is 200, the URL is considered valid. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly validates URLs.", "Step 4: Implement the custom short link feature. Modify the URL shortening function to accept an optional parameter for a custom short link. If the custom short link is provided and is not already in use, the function should return it instead of generating a new one. Write tests to ensure that the function correctly handles custom short links.", "Step 5: Implement the redirection feature. In the 'app.py' file, add a route that matches the pattern of the shortened URLs. When a request is made to a shortened URL, the application should redirect to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the analytics feature. Create a 'analytics.py' file that will contain functions to track and retrieve statistics about shortened URLs. The statistics will include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. The geographical location can be determined from the IP address of the request. Write tests to ensure that the analytics functions work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a 'user_accounts.py' file that will contain functions to handle user registration, login, and management of shortened URLs. The functions will interact with a mock database represented by an in-memory dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the user account functions work correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In the 'app.py' file, add routes for the admin dashboard. The dashboard will display all shortened URLs and user accounts, and allow administrators to delete any URL or user account. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functions work correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the URL expiration feature. Modify the URL shortening function to accept an optional parameter for an expiration date/time. If the expiration date/time is provided, the shortened URL should become inactive after that time. Write tests to ensure that the URL expiration feature works correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, integrate all the features in the 'app.py' file. The application should provide routes for users to input URLs to be shortened, access shortened URLs, view analytics, manage their accounts, and access the admin dashboard.
