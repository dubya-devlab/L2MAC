Start by setting up the project structure and necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to manage the project dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest for testing, and requests for making HTTP requests to validate URLs. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `Shortener` class in a file named `shortener.py`. This class should have a method `shorten_url` that takes a URL as input and returns a shortened version of the URL. The shortened URL can be generated by hashing the original URL and taking a substring of the hash. Write tests to ensure that the `shorten_url` method works correctly and always returns a unique shortened URL for each unique input URL.", "3. Implement the URL validation feature. Add a method `validate_url` to the `Shortener` class. This method should take a URL as input and return a boolean indicating whether the URL is active and legitimate. You can check this by making a GET request to the URL and checking the response status code. Write tests to ensure that the `validate_url` method correctly identifies active and legitimate URLs.", "4. Implement the custom short link feature. Modify the `shorten_url` method to accept an optional second argument for a custom short link. If a custom short link is provided, the method should return it instead of generating a new one. However, it should first check that the custom short link is not already in use. Write tests to ensure that the `shorten_url` method correctly handles custom short links.", "5. Implement the redirection feature. In the Flask application, add a route that matches the pattern of the shortened URLs. When this route is accessed, it should redirect to the original URL associated with the shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that accessing a shortened URL correctly redirects to the original URL.", "6. Implement the analytics feature. Create an `Analytics` class in a file named `analytics.py`. This class should have methods to record a click on a shortened URL and to retrieve statistics about a shortened URL. The statistics should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. Write tests to ensure that the `Analytics` class correctly records and retrieves statistics.", "7. Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `User` class in a file named `user.py`. This class should have methods to create an account, view all shortened URLs associated with an account, edit or delete a shortened URL, and view analytics for all shortened URLs. Write tests to ensure that the `User` class correctly manages user accounts and their associated URLs.", "8. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `Admin` class in a file named `admin.py`. This class should inherit from the `User` class and have additional methods to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the `Admin` class correctly manages administrative tasks.", "9. Implement the expiration feature. Modify the `Shortener` class to accept an optional expiration date/time when creating a shortened URL. When a shortened URL is accessed, it should first check whether the URL has expired before redirecting. If the URL has expired, it should return an error message instead of redirecting. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature works correctly.", "10. Finally, integrate all the features in the Flask application. The application should provide routes for users to input a URL to be shortened, access a shortened URL, view statistics about a shortened URL, create an account, view all their shortened URLs, edit or delete a shortened URL, view analytics for all their shortened URLs, and set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. Write tests to ensure that all routes work correctly and all features are integrated properly."], "step": "7. Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `User` class in a file named `user.py`. This class should have methods to create an account, view all shortened URLs associated with an account, edit or delete a shortened URL, and view analytics for all shortened URLs.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
