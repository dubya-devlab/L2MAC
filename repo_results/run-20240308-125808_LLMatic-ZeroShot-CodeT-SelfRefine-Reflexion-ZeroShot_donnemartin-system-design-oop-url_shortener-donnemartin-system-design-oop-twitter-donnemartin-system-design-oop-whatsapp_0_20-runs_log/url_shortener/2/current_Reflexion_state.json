Users can input a URL to be shortened.\n   - [ ] 1.2. The system validates that the URL is active and legitimate.\n   - [ ] 1.3. The system generates a unique shortened URL.\n   - [ ] 1.4.

Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 3.2. View number of clicks.\n   - [ ] 3.3. View date/time of each click.\n   - [ ] 3.4.

Administrators can monitor system performance and analytics.\n\n6. **Expiration**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Users can set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL.\n```\n\nThe failure in the test case for URL expiration is likely due to the way the expiration date is being handled in the code. The test case is expecting a dictionary response with an 'error' key, but the actual response is a tuple with the dictionary and a status code. This discrepancy is causing the test to fail.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, the test case should be updated to correctly handle the tuple response. The test should check for the 'error' key in the first element of the response tuple, not in the tuple itself. \n\nAdditionally, the code for handling URL expiration could be improved. Currently, the code checks if the current time is less than the expiration date, but it would be more accurate to check if the current time is greater than or equal to the expiration date. This would ensure that the URL expires exactly at the specified expiration date and time, not a moment later. \n\nThe high level plan to fix this issue would be:\n\n1. Update the 'redirect_to_url' function in 'url_shortener.py' to check if the current time is greater than or equal to the URL's expiration date.\n2. Update the 'test_url_expiration' function in 'test_url_shortener.py' to correctly handle the tuple response from 'redirect_to_url'.\n3. Run the tests again to ensure they all pass.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
