Create a new Python Flask application with the following files: `app.py` (the main application file), `models.py` (for database models), `views.py` (for handling HTTP requests), `utils.py` (for utility functions), and `tests.py` (for unit tests). Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the Python packages needed for this project. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the User model in the `models.py` file. The User model should have fields for username, password, and a list of URLs that the user has shortened. Also, implement the URL model. The URL model should have fields for the original URL, the shortened URL, the user who created it, the creation date, the expiration date, and a list of click events. Each click event should record the date/time of the click and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing the models, write tests to ensure that the models are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the URL shortening feature in the `views.py` file. Create a new route that accepts a POST request with the original URL and an optional custom short link. The route should validate the URL, generate a unique shortened URL (or use the custom short link if provided), save the URL to the database, and return the shortened URL. After implementing the URL shortening feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the redirection feature in the `views.py` file. Create a new route that accepts a GET request with the shortened URL. The route should retrieve the original URL from the database, record a new click event, and redirect the user to the original URL. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the analytics feature in the `views.py` file. Create a new route that accepts a GET request with the shortened URL and returns the statistics about the URL. The statistics should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of each clicker. After implementing the analytics feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the user accounts feature in the `views.py` file. Create new routes for user registration, login, and logout. Also, create a new route that accepts a GET request with the username and returns all the URLs that the user has shortened. After implementing the user accounts feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard feature in the `views.py` file. Create new routes for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting a URL, and deleting a user account. These routes should be accessible only to users with admin privileges. After implementing the admin dashboard feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration feature in the `views.py` file. Modify the URL shortening route to accept an optional expiration date/time. The redirection route should check the expiration date/time before redirecting the user to the original URL. If the URL has expired, the route should return an error message. After implementing the URL expiration feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the system performance monitoring feature in the `views.py` file. Create a new route that returns the system performance metrics, such as the total number of URLs, the total number of clicks, and the average number of clicks per URL. This route should be accessible only to users with admin privileges. After implementing the system performance monitoring feature, write tests to ensure that the feature is working correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, run all the tests to ensure that all the features are working correctly. If any test fails, debug the code and fix the issue.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
