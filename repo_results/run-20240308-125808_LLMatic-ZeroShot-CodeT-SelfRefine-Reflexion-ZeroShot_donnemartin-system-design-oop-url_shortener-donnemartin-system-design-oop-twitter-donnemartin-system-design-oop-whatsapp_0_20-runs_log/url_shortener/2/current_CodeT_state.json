Users can input a URL to be shortened.\n   - [ ] 1.2. The system validates that the URL is active and legitimate.\n   - [ ] 1.3. The system generates a unique shortened URL.\n   - [ ] 1.4. Users can choose custom short links (subject to availability).\n\n2. **Redirection**:\n   - [ ] 2.1. Accessing the shortened URL redirects to the original URL.\n\n3. **Analytics**:\n   - [ ] 3.1. Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 3.2. View number of clicks.\n   - [ ] 3.3. View date/time of each click.\n   - [ ] 3.4. View geographical location of the clicker.\n\n4. **User Accounts**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can create accounts.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Account holders can view all their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.3. Account holders can edit or delete their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.4. Account holders can view analytics for all their shortened URLs.\n\n5. **Admin Dashboard**:\n   - [ ] 5.1. Administrators can view all shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 5.2. Administrators can delete any URL or user account.\n   - [ ] 5.3. Administrators can monitor system performance and analytics.\n\n6. **Expiration**:\n   - [ ] 6.1. Users can set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL.\n```\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}], "base_dialog": [], "sub_messages": []}
