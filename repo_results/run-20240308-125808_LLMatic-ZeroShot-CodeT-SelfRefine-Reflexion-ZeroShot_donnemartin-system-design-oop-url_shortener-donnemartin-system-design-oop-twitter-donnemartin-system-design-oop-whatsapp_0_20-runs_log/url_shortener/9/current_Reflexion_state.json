Users can input a URL to be shortened.\n   - [ ] 1.2. The system validates that the URL is active and legitimate.\n   - [ ] 1.3. The system generates a unique shortened URL.\n   - [ ] 1.4.

Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 3.2. View number of clicks.\n   - [ ] 3.3. View date/time of each click.\n   - [ ] 3.4. View geographical location of the clicker.\n\n4. **User Accounts**:\n   - [ ] 4.1. Users can create accounts.\n   - [ ] 4.2. Account holders can view all their shortened URLs.\n   - [ ] 4.3.

However, there are still some features missing, such as custom short links, analytics for clicks and geographical location, an admin dashboard, and the ability for users to edit or delete their shortened URLs. \n\nThe discrepancy in the evaluation might be due to the fact that some features were partially implemented but not fully. For example, the code does track the number of clicks for each URL, but it does not provide a way for users to view this data, so the analytics feature is not fully implemented.\n\nTo improve the code, the following plan can be followed:\n\n1. Implement the missing features one by one, starting with the simpler ones like allowing users to choose custom short links and to edit or delete their URLs.\n2. For the analytics feature, a new endpoint can be created where users can view the number of clicks for each of their URLs. The geographical location of the clicker can be determined using the request's IP address.\n3. For the admin dashboard, a new user role can be introduced, and users with this role can have access to additional endpoints where they can view all URLs and user accounts, and delete any URL or user account.\n4. Finally, tests should be written for each new feature to ensure they work as expected.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
