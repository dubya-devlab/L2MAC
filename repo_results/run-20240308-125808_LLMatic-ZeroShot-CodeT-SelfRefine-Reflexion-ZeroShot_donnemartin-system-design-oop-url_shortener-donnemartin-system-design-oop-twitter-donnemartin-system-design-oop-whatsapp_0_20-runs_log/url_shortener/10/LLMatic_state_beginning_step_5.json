Create a Flask application in a file named 'app.py'. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask for the web framework, pytest for testing, and requests for making HTTP requests to validate URLs. At this stage, also create a 'test_app.py' file where you will write tests for the application. Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a 'url_shortener.py' file and define a function 'generate_short_url' that takes a URL as input and returns a shortened version of it. The function should generate a unique identifier for each URL. Also, allow users to choose a custom short link if they want to. Write tests in 'test_url_shortener.py' to ensure that the function correctly generates unique short URLs and handles custom short link requests.", "Step 3: Implement the URL validation feature. In the 'url_shortener.py' file, define a function 'validate_url' that takes a URL as input and checks if it is active and legitimate by making a GET request to it. If the request is successful, the function should return True, otherwise False. Write tests in 'test_url_shortener.py' to ensure that the function correctly validates URLs.", "Step 4: Implement the redirection feature. In the 'app.py' file, define a route that takes a short URL as input and redirects to the original URL. Use the 'url_shortener' functions to get the original URL from the short URL. Write tests in 'test_app.py' to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a 'user.py' file and define a User class with attributes for username, password, and a list of shortened URLs. Also, define methods for creating, editing, and deleting users. Write tests in 'test_user.py' to ensure that the User class and its methods work correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the analytics feature. Create an 'analytics.py' file and define a function 'get_url_stats' that takes a short URL as input and returns statistics about it, such as the number of clicks, date/time of each click, and geographical location of the clicker. Write tests in 'test_analytics.py' to ensure that the function correctly calculates and returns URL statistics.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In the 'app.py' file, define a route that allows administrators to view all shortened URLs and user accounts, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests in 'test_app.py' to ensure that the admin dashboard works correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration feature. In the 'url_shortener.py' file, modify the 'generate_short_url' function to accept an optional expiration date/time. If provided, the function should store this information and the short URL should stop working after the expiration date/time. Write tests in 'test_url_shortener.py' to ensure that the URL expiration feature works correctly.", "Step 9: Integrate all the features in the Flask application. In the 'app.py' file, define routes for each feature, such as URL shortening, redirection, user account management, analytics, admin dashboard, and URL expiration. Use the functions and classes defined in the other files to implement the functionality of each route. Write tests in 'test_app.py' to ensure that all routes work correctly and all features are integrated properly.", "Step 10: Finally, run all tests to ensure that the entire application works as expected. If any tests fail, debug the corresponding code and fix the issues. Once all tests pass, the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "Step 6: Implement the analytics feature. Create an 'analytics.py' file and define a function 'get_url_stats' that takes a short URL as input and returns statistics about it, such as the number of clicks, date/time of each click, and geographical location of the clicker.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
