Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary dependencies for the project. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and any other necessary libraries. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain the logic for shortening URLs. This should include a function to validate the URL, a function to generate a unique shortened URL, and a function to handle custom short links. The URL validation function should check if the URL is active and legitimate. The unique shortened URL generation function should generate a unique identifier for each URL. The custom short link function should allow users to choose a custom short link, subject to availability. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, create a route that will handle the redirection of the shortened URLs to the original URLs. This route should take the unique identifier or the custom short link as a parameter and redirect the user to the original URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain the logic for tracking and displaying analytics. This should include functions to track the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. The tracking should be done using an in-memory dictionary to mock a database. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that the analytics are tracked and displayed correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain the logic for handling user accounts. This should include functions to create accounts, view all shortened URLs associated with an account, edit or delete shortened URLs, and view analytics for all shortened URLs. The user account data should be stored in an in-memory dictionary to mock a database. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that the user account features work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create a `admin_dashboard.py` file that will contain the logic for the admin dashboard. This should include functions to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard features work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the URL expiration feature. In the `url_shortener.py` file, add a function to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. This function should take the unique identifier or the custom short link and the expiration date/time as parameters. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the URL expiration works correctly.", "Step 8: Integrate all the features in the `app.py` file. Create routes for each feature and use the functions implemented in the previous steps to handle the logic for each route. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application works as a whole.", "Step 9: Run all the tests written in the previous steps using pytest. Fix any errors or issues that come up during testing. After all the tests pass, the application should be fully functional.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire codebase to ensure that it follows best practices for Python and Flask.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
