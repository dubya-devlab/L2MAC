Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary dependencies for the project. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and any other necessary libraries. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `Shortener` class in a file named `shortener.py`. This class should have a method `shorten_url` that takes a URL as input and returns a shortened version of the URL. The method should generate a unique identifier for each URL and use it to create the shortened URL. After implementing the `shorten_url` method, write a test to ensure that it correctly shortens URLs and that each shortened URL is unique.", "Step 3: Implement the URL validation feature. Add a method `validate_url` to the `Shortener` class. This method should take a URL as input and return a boolean indicating whether the URL is active and legitimate. You can use the `requests` library to send a GET request to the URL and check the response status. After implementing the `validate_url` method, write a test to ensure that it correctly validates URLs.", "Step 4: Implement the redirection feature. In the Flask application, add a route that matches the pattern of the shortened URLs. When this route is accessed, it should redirect to the original URL. You can use the `redirect` function from Flask to achieve this. After implementing the redirection feature, write a test to ensure that accessing a shortened URL correctly redirects to the original URL.", "Step 5: Implement the analytics feature. Create an `Analytics` class in a file named `analytics.py`. This class should have methods to track and retrieve statistics about shortened URLs, such as the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. After implementing the `Analytics` class, write tests to ensure that it correctly tracks and retrieves statistics.", "Step 6: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `User` class in a file named `user.py`. This class should have methods to create an account, view all shortened URLs associated with the account, edit or delete shortened URLs, and view analytics for all shortened URLs. After implementing the `User` class, write tests to ensure that it correctly manages user accounts and their associated URLs.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `Admin` class in a file named `admin.py`. This class should inherit from the `User` class and have additional methods to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing the `Admin` class, write tests to ensure that it correctly manages administrative tasks.", "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration feature. Add a method `set_expiration` to the `Shortener` class. This method should take a URL and an expiration date/time as input and ensure that the URL is no longer accessible after the specified date/time. After implementing the `set_expiration` method, write a test to ensure that it correctly sets URL expiration.", "Step 9: Integrate all the features in the Flask application. The application should provide routes for users to input URLs to be shortened, access shortened URLs, view statistics about their URLs, manage their accounts, and access the admin dashboard. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application correctly handles all the routes and their associated functionalities.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive test of the entire system.

When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}], "message_hash": "75f7263f94b16e575dab1e92a2c973c02a653f1e20be9fcc91b0d01c05bd4d0e"}
