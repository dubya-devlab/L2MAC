["Step 1: Start by setting up the project structure and the necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask, pytest, and requests (for URL validation). Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain the logic for URL shortening. This will include a function to validate the URL, a function to generate a unique shortened URL, and a function to handle custom short links. The URL validation function should send a GET request to the URL and check the response status. The URL shortening function should generate a unique string of characters that will serve as the shortened URL. The custom short link function should check if the custom link is already in use and return an error if it is. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening functions work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that will handle the redirection. This route should take the shortened URL as a parameter, look up the original URL in the database, and redirect to it. If the shortened URL is not found in the database, it should return a 404 error. Write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain the logic for tracking and displaying analytics. This will include functions to record a click (including the date/time and geographical location), to retrieve the number of clicks for a specific shortened URL, and to retrieve the details of each click. The geographical location can be determined from the IP address of the clicker, using a package like geoip2. Write tests to ensure that the analytics functions work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain the logic for user account management. This will include functions to create an account, to retrieve all shortened URLs for a user, to edit a shortened URL, and to delete a shortened URL. The user account data can be stored in a dictionary for now, with the username as the key and a list of shortened URLs as the value. Write tests to ensure that the user account functions work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `admin_dashboard.py` file that will contain the logic for the admin dashboard. This will include functions to retrieve all shortened URLs, to delete a URL, and to delete a user account. The admin dashboard should also display system performance and analytics, which can be retrieved from the `analytics.py` file. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard functions work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the expiration feature. Add a function in the `url_shortener.py` file to set an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. This function should add the expiration date/time to the URL data in the database. The redirection function should then check the expiration date/time before redirecting, and return a 404 error if the URL has expired. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature works correctly.", "Step 8: Integrate all the features in the Flask application. The `app.py` file should import the necessary functions from the other files and use them to handle the different routes. The routes should include the URL shortening route, the redirection route, the analytics route, the user account routes, the admin dashboard routes, and the expiration route. Write tests to ensure that all the routes work as expected.", "Step 9: Refactor the code and improve the tests. Go through all the code and make sure it follows best practices for Python and Flask. This includes proper use of dataclasses, clear and concise comments, and appropriate error handling. Also, improve the tests to cover more edge cases and to check the integration of the different features.", "Step 10: Run all the tests and fix any issues. Use pytest to run all the tests and check the results. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues. Once all the tests pass, the implementation of the online URL shortening service is complete."], "step": "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain the logic for user account management. This will include functions to create an account, to retrieve all shortened URLs for a user, to edit a shortened URL, and to delete a shortened URL. The user account data can be stored in a dictionary for now, with the username as the key and a list of shortened URLs as the value.
