structure. Create a Flask application with the necessary routes for the URL shortening service. The routes should include '/shorten' for shortening URLs, '/' for redirecting shortened URLs to their original URLs, '/analytics' for viewing URL analytics, '/account' for user account related operations, and '/admin' for admin dashboard. Also, create a 'mock_db.py' file to simulate a database using an in-memory dictionary. This file should contain functions for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting data. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application and the mock database are set up correctly.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. In the '/shorten' route, accept a URL from the user, validate it, and generate a unique shortened URL. If the user provides a custom short link, check its availability and use it if it's available. Store the original URL and its shortened version in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the URL shortening feature works as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In the '/' route, accept a shortened URL, retrieve the original URL from the mock database, and redirect the user to the original URL. Write tests to ensure that the redirection feature works as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. In the '/analytics' route, accept a shortened URL, retrieve its analytics data from the mock database, and display it to the user. The analytics data should include the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker. Write tests to ensure that the analytics feature works as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. In the '/account' route, provide options for users to create accounts, view their shortened URLs, edit or delete their shortened URLs, and view analytics for their shortened URLs. Store the user account data in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the user accounts feature works as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. In the '/admin' route, provide options for administrators to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. Write tests to ensure that the admin dashboard feature works as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the expiration feature. In the '/shorten' route, accept an optional expiration date/time for the shortened URL from the user. Store the expiration date/time in the mock database along with the URL data. In the '/' route, before redirecting a shortened URL, check its expiration date/time and only redirect if it hasn't expired. Write tests to ensure that the expiration feature works as expected.", "Step 8: Implement a function to update the analytics data. This function should be called every time a shortened URL is clicked. It should increment the click count, add the current date/time to the click times, and add the clicker's geographical location to the locations. Write tests to ensure that the analytics data is updated correctly.", "Step 9: Implement a function to validate URLs. This function should be called in the '/shorten' route before a URL is shortened. It should check if the URL is active and legitimate. Write tests to ensure that the URL validation function works as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire codebase to ensure that all requirements have been implemented correctly and that all tests pass. Make any necessary adjustments to the code and tests. Run all tests to ensure that the URL shortening service works as expected."], "step": "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
