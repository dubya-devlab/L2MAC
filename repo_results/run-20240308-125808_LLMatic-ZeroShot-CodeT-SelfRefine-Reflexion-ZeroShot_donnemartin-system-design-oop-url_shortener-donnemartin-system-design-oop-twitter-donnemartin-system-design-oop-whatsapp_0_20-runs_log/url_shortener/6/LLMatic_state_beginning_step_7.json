Start by setting up the project structure and necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to manage the project dependencies. The dependencies will include Flask, pytest for testing, and requests for making HTTP requests to validate URLs. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "2. Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `Shortener` class in a file named `shortener.py`. This class will have methods for generating short URLs and validating URLs. The `generate_short_url` method will take a URL and return a shortened version of it. The `validate_url` method will take a URL and return a boolean indicating whether the URL is valid or not. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "3. Implement the redirection feature. In the Flask application, add a route that takes a short URL and redirects to the original URL. This will involve looking up the original URL associated with the short URL in the `Shortener` class. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that accessing a short URL correctly redirects to the original URL.", "4. Implement the analytics feature. Add methods to the `Shortener` class for recording and retrieving analytics data. The `record_click` method will take a short URL and record a click event. The `get_clicks` method will take a short URL and return the number of clicks. The `get_click_details` method will take a short URL and return detailed information about each click, such as the date/time and geographical location. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "5. Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `User` class in a file named `user.py`. This class will have methods for creating an account, viewing all shortened URLs associated with an account, and editing or deleting shortened URLs. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "6. Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `Admin` class in a file named `admin.py`. This class will inherit from the `User` class and have additional methods for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "7. Implement the expiration feature. Add a method to the `Shortener` class for setting an expiration date/time for a shortened URL. The `set_expiration` method will take a short URL and a datetime object and set the expiration date/time for the short URL. After implementing this method, write tests to ensure that it works as expected.", "8. Integrate all the features in the Flask application. Add routes for each feature, such as URL shortening, redirection, viewing analytics, managing user accounts, accessing the admin dashboard, and setting URL expiration. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application works as a whole.", "9. Implement error handling in the Flask application. Add error handlers for common HTTP errors, such as 404 Not Found and 500 Internal Server Error. Also, add error handling in the `Shortener`, `User`, and `Admin` classes to handle potential errors, such as invalid URLs and non-existent user accounts. After implementing error handling, write tests to ensure that errors are handled correctly.", "10. Finally, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application. Run all the tests written in the previous steps to ensure that all features work as expected. Also, write additional tests if necessary to cover edge cases and complex scenarios.
