Finally, I would implement the URL expiration feature, allowing users to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. \n\nBy incrementally adding these features, I can ensure that each feature is fully functional before moving on to the next, reducing the likelihood of errors and ensuring a comprehensive implementation of the original specifications.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, redirect\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\nimport datetime\\nimport random\\nimport string\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n# Mock database\\nurls = {}\\nusers = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tusername: str\\n\\tpassword: str\\n\\turls: dict\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass URL:\\n\\toriginal_url: str\\n\\tshort_url: str\\n\\texpiration_date: datetime.datetime\\n\\tclicks: int\\n\\n@app.route('/shorten_url', methods=['POST'])\\ndef shorten_url():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\toriginal_url = data['original_url']\\n\\tshort_url = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits, k=5))\\n\\texpiration_date = datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=30)\\n\\turls[short_url] = URL(original_url, short_url, expiration_date, 0)\\n\\treturn {'short_url': short_url}\\n\\n@app.route('/<short_url>', methods=['GET'])\\ndef redirect_to_url(short_url):\\n\\turl = urls.get(short_url)\\n\\tif url and url.expiration_date > datetime.datetime.now():\\n\\t\\turl.clicks += 1\\n\\t\\treturn redirect(url.original_url, code=302)\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn {'error': 'URL not found or expired'}, 404\\n\\n@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])\\ndef register():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tusername = data['username']\\n\\tpassword = data['password']\\n\\tif username in users:\\n\\t\\treturn {'error': 'Username already exists'}, 400\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\tusers[username] = User(username, password, {})\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'User registered successfully'}, 200\\n\\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\\ndef login():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tusername = data['username']\\n\\tpassword = data['password']\\n\\tuser = users.get(username)\\n\\tif user and user.password == password:\\n\\t\\treturn {'message': 'Logged in successfully'}, 200\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn {'error': 'Invalid username or password'}, 400\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nimport datetime\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('original_url', [\\n\\t'http://example.com',\\n\\t'https://google.com',\\n\\t'http://test.com'\\n])\\ndef test_shorten_url(client, original_url):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/shorten_url', json={'original_url': original_url})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert 'short_url' in response.get_json()\\n\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('short_url', [\\n\\t'ABCDE',\\n\\t'12345',\\n\\t'XYZ12'\\n])\\ndef test_redirect_to_url(client, short_url):\\n\\tapp.urls[short_url] = app.URL('http://example.com', short_url, datetime.datetime.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=30), 0)\\n\\tresponse = client.get(f'/{short_url}')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 302\\n\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('username, password', [\\n\\t('user1', 'pass1'),\\n\\t('user2', 'pass2'),\\n\\t('user3', 'pass3')\\n])\\ndef test_register(client, username, password):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/register', json={'username': username, 'password': password})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert 'message' in response.get_json()\\n\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('username, password', [\\n\\t('user1', 'pass1'),\\n\\t('user2', 'pass2'),\\n\\t('user3', 'pass3')\\n])\\ndef test_login(client, username, password):\\n\\tapp.users[username] = app.User(username, password, {})\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/login', json={'username': username, 'password': password})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert 'message' in response.get_json()\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "name": "write_files"}, "role": "assistant"}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"All tests passed.\"}"}]}
