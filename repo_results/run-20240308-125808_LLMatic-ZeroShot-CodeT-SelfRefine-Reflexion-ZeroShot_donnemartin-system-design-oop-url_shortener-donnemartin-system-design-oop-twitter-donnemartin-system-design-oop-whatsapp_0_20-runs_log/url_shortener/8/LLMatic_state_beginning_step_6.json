Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask for the web framework, pytest for testing, and requests for making HTTP requests to validate URLs. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain the logic for shortening URLs. This will include a function to validate URLs, a function to generate unique shortened URLs, and a function to handle custom short links. The URL validation function will make a GET request to the URL and check the response status. The unique shortened URL generation function will use a simple hashing algorithm to generate a unique hash for each URL. The custom short link function will check if the custom link is already in use and if not, assign it to the URL. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In the `app.py` file, add a route that will handle the redirection. This route will take the shortened URL as a parameter, look it up in the in-memory database, and redirect to the original URL if found. If the shortened URL is not found, it will return a 404 error. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that it works correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain the logic for tracking and displaying analytics. This will include functions to track clicks, record the date/time of each click, and record the geographical location of the clicker. The geographical location can be determined from the IP address of the request. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain the logic for handling user accounts. This will include functions to create accounts, view all shortened URLs associated with an account, edit or delete shortened URLs, and view analytics for all shortened URLs. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `admin_dashboard.py` file that will contain the logic for the admin dashboard. This will include functions to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the expiration feature. Add a function in the `url_shortener.py` file to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. This function will add an expiration date/time to the URL data in the in-memory database. The redirection feature will need to be updated to check the expiration date/time before redirecting. If the current date/time is past the expiration date/time, it will return a 404 error. After implementing the expiration feature, write tests to ensure that it works correctly.", "Step 8: Integrate all the features in the Flask application. Update the `app.py` file to include routes for all the features. This will include routes for shortening URLs, redirecting, viewing analytics, managing user accounts, accessing the admin dashboard, and setting URL expiration. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application works as a whole.", "Step 9: Perform a final review of the code and tests. Check that all the code follows best practices and that all the tests cover all the features and edge cases. Run all the tests and ensure that they all pass.", "Step 10: Document the project. Write a README file that explains what the project does, how to set it up, and how to use it. Include information about each feature and how it works.
