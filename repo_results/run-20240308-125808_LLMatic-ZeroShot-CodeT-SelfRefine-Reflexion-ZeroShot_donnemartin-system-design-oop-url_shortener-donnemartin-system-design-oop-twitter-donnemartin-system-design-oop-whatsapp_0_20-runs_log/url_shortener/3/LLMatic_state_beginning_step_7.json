After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `url_shortener.py` file that will contain the logic for shortening URLs. This should include a function to validate the URL, a function to generate a unique shortened URL, and a function to handle custom short links. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work as expected. The tests should cover various scenarios, including valid and invalid URLs, and custom and non-custom short links.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. This should be a route in the Flask application that takes a shortened URL and redirects to the original URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the redirection works correctly. The tests should cover various scenarios, including valid and invalid shortened URLs.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Create a `analytics.py` file that will contain the logic for tracking and displaying analytics.

After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work as expected. The tests should cover various scenarios, including different numbers of clicks and different geographical locations.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `user_accounts.py` file that will contain the logic for managing user accounts. This should include functions to create an account, view all shortened URLs associated with an account, edit or delete shortened URLs, and view analytics for all shortened URLs. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work as expected. The tests should cover various scenarios, including creating, editing, and deleting accounts, and viewing and editing shortened URLs.", "Step 6: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create a `admin_dashboard.py` file that will contain the logic for the admin dashboard. This should include functions to view all shortened URLs, delete any URL or user account, and monitor system performance and analytics. After implementing these functions, write tests to ensure that they work as expected. The tests should cover various scenarios, including viewing and deleting URLs and user accounts, and monitoring system performance and analytics.", "Step 7: Implement the expiration feature. This should be a function in the `url_shortener.py` file that allows users to set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the expiration works correctly. The tests should cover various scenarios, including setting and not setting an expiration date/time, and accessing a URL after it has expired.", "Step 8: Integrate all the features into the Flask application.
