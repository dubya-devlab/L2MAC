This includes the main application file (app.py), a configuration file (config.py), a file for user management (user.py), a file for message management (message.py), a file for group management (group.py), and a file for status management (status.py). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write a test to ensure that all files are created successfully and can be accessed.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating a User class in user.py with methods for signing up and password recovery. The User class should have attributes such as email, password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. The sign-up method should take email and password as parameters, and the password recovery method should take email as a parameter. After implementing user registration and authentication, write tests to ensure that a user can sign up and recover their password.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating methods in the User class for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for managing privacy settings. The set_profile_picture method should take a picture file as a parameter, the set_status_message method should take a status message as a parameter, and the manage_privacy_settings method should take privacy settings as parameters. After implementing user profile management, write tests to ensure that a user can set their profile picture and status message, and manage their privacy settings.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating a Contact class in user.py with methods for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The Contact class should have attributes such as user and blocked status. The block_contact and unblock_contact methods should take a user as a parameter, and the create_group, edit_group, and manage_group methods should take group details as parameters. After implementing contact management, write tests to ensure that a user can block and unblock contacts, and create, edit, and manage groups.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating a Message class in message.py with methods for sending and receiving real-time text messages, for managing read receipts, for encrypting and decrypting messages, and for sharing images. The Message class should have attributes such as sender, receiver, text, read receipt, encryption key, and image. The send_message and receive_message methods should take a receiver and a text as parameters, the manage_read_receipt method should take a read receipt as a parameter, the encrypt_message and decrypt_message methods should take a text and an encryption key as parameters, and the share_image method should take an image as a parameter. After implementing messaging, write tests to ensure that a user can send and receive real-time text messages, manage read receipts, encrypt and decrypt messages, and share images.", "Step 6: Implement group chats. This includes creating a Group class in group.py with methods for creating group chats, for adding and removing participants, and for managing admin roles and permissions. The Group class should have attributes such as name, picture, participants, and admins. The create_group_chat method should take a name and a picture as parameters, the add_participant and remove_participant methods should take a participant as a parameter, and the manage_admin_roles_and_permissions method should take admin roles and permissions as parameters. After implementing group chats, write tests to ensure that a user can create group chats, add and remove participants, and manage admin roles and permissions.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating a Status class in status.py with methods for posting image statuses and for managing who can see the status. The Status class should have attributes such as user, image, visibility time, and viewers. The post_image_status method should take an image and a visibility time as parameters, and the manage_viewers method should take viewers as parameters. After implementing the status/story feature, write tests to ensure that a user can post image statuses and manage who can see their status.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes setting up a Flask application in app.py, defining routes for the different features, and creating templates for the different views. The Flask application should use the classes and methods defined in the other files to provide the functionality of the chat service. After implementing the web application, write tests to ensure that the application runs correctly and that the routes return the expected results.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating methods in the Message class for queuing messages when the user is offline and for displaying the online/offline status. The queue_message method should take a message as a parameter and add it to a queue, and the display_online_status method should return the online status of the user. After implementing connectivity and offline mode, write tests to ensure that messages are queued when the user is offline and that the online status is displayed correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, run all the tests to ensure that all features of the chat service are working correctly. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
