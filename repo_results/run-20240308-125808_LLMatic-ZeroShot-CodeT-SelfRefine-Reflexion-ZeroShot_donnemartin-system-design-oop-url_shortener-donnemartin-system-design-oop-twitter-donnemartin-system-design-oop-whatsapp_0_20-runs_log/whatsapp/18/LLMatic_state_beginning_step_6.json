up the basic structure of the application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The database should have tables for users, messages, groups, and statuses. Each table should have appropriate fields according to the data it needs to store. For example, the users table should have fields for email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, and blocked contacts. Write tests to ensure that data can be added, retrieved, updated, and deleted from the mock database correctly.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept an email and password, and add a new user to the users table in the mock database. The forgotten password recovery route should accept an email, verify that it exists in the users table, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the sign up and forgotten password recovery routes work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept a user id and the new picture or message, and update the corresponding field in the users table. The privacy settings route should accept a user id and the new settings, and update the privacy settings field in the users table. Write tests to ensure that the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings routes work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept a user id and a contact id, and add or remove the contact from the blocked contacts field of the user in the users table. The group management routes should allow creating, editing, and deleting groups in the groups table. Write tests to ensure that the block, unblock, and group management routes work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, and handling read receipts and end-to-end encryption. The send and receive routes should add and retrieve messages from the messages table. The read receipts route should update the read status of a message in the messages table. The encryption should be handled using a suitable Python library. Write tests to ensure that the send, receive, read receipts, and encryption routes work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement image sharing and support for emojis, GIFs, and stickers in messages. This includes updating the send and receive routes to handle images, emojis, GIFs, and stickers. The images can be stored as URLs in the messages table. The emojis, GIFs, and stickers can be handled using suitable Python libraries. Write tests to ensure that images, emojis, GIFs, and stickers can be sent and received correctly.", "Step 7: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding and removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The group chats should be stored in the groups table, with a list of participant ids and admin ids. The add and remove participants routes should update the list of participant ids in the group. The admin roles and permissions should be handled by a separate field in the groups table. Write tests to ensure that group chats, participants, and admin roles and permissions can be managed correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and controlling who can see the status. The statuses should be stored in the statuses table, with a field for the image URL and a field for the list of viewer ids. The post status route should add a new status to the statuses table. The control viewers route should update the list of viewer ids for a status. Write tests to ensure that statuses can be posted and viewers can be controlled correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the web application. This includes creating a Flask application with routes for all the features implemented so far. The application should be accessible from browsers and should provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chat service. Write tests to ensure that all the routes in the web application work as expected.", "Step 10: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a mechanism for queuing messages when the user is offline and sending them once connectivity is restored. The online/offline status of a user can be stored in the users table and updated whenever the user connects or disconnects. Write tests to ensure that messages are queued and sent correctly, and that the online/offline status is updated correctly."], "step": "Step 7: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding and removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The group chats should be stored in the groups table, with a list of participant ids and admin ids. The add and remove participants routes should update the list of participant ids in the group.
