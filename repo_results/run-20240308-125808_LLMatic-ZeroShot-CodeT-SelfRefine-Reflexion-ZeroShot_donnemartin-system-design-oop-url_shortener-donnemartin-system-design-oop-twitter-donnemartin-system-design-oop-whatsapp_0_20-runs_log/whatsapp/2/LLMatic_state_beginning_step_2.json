This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'mock_db.py' file to simulate a database using an in-memory dictionary. This file should include functions to add, update, delete, and retrieve data. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database functions are working as expected.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating a User class in a 'user.py' file with attributes such as email, password, and other necessary details. In the 'app.py' file, create routes for user registration and login. The registration route should add a new user to the mock database, while the login route should check if the user exists in the database and if the password is correct. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that user registration and login are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement user profile features. This includes allowing users to set profile pictures and status messages, and setting privacy settings. Add methods to the User class to set and get these attributes. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file to handle these actions. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the user profile features are working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement contact management features. This includes blocking/unblocking contacts and managing groups. Create a Contact class in a 'contact.py' file with necessary attributes and methods. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file to handle these actions. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the contact management features are working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement messaging features. This includes sending and receiving real-time text messages, message read receipts, end-to-end encryption, image sharing, and support for emojis, GIFs, and stickers. Create a Message class in a 'message.py' file with necessary attributes and methods. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file to handle these actions. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the messaging features are working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement group chat features. This includes creating group chats, adding or removing participants, and setting admin roles and permissions. Create a GroupChat class in a 'group_chat.py' file with necessary attributes and methods. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file to handle these actions. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the group chat features are working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement status/story features. This includes allowing users to post image statuses visible for a limited time and controlling who can see the status. Add methods to the User class to handle these actions. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file to handle these actions. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the status/story features are working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application. This includes creating a web-based version of the application accessible from browsers. Use Flask's template rendering to create the web pages. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the web application is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode features. This includes message queuing for when the user is offline and displaying online/offline status. Add methods to the User and Message classes to handle these actions. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file to handle these actions. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features are working correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application. This includes running all the tests written in the previous steps and ensuring that they all pass. Also, perform additional tests to check for edge cases and potential errors. After performing the tests, fix any issues that are found and re-run the tests until all of them pass."], "step": "Step 3: Implement user profile features.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
