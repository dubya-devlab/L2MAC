This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The dictionary should have keys as user IDs and values as another dictionary containing user details such as email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the application setup is correct and the 'users' dictionary is functioning as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept user details, generate a unique user ID, and store the details in the 'users' dictionary. The forgotten password recovery route should accept a user ID and send a password reset link to the user's email. Since we can't actually send emails, just simulate this by printing a message. Write tests to ensure that the sign up and password recovery features are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. The routes should accept a user ID and the new details, and update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the profile features are working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking/unblocking contacts and managing groups. The routes should accept a user ID and the contact or group details, and update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the contact management features are working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, sharing images, and supporting emojis, GIFs, and stickers. Since we can't actually send messages, just simulate this by storing messages in a 'messages' dictionary with keys as conversation IDs and values as lists of messages. Each message should be a dictionary containing the sender ID, content, type (text, image, emoji, etc.), and read receipt status. Write tests to ensure that the messaging features are working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding/removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The routes should accept a user ID and the group details, and update the corresponding entries in the 'users' and 'messages' dictionaries. Write tests to ensure that the group chat features are working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and controlling who can see the status. The routes should accept a user ID and the status details, and store the statuses in a 'statuses' dictionary with keys as user IDs and values as lists of statuses. Each status should be a dictionary containing the image, visibility settings, and expiry time. Write tests to ensure that the status/story feature is working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a route for accessing the application from a browser. The route should return a simple HTML page with links to the other routes. Write tests to ensure that the web application feature is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a route for updating the online/offline status of a user, and storing unsent messages in a 'queue' dictionary with keys as user IDs and values as lists of messages. The route for sending messages should check the recipient's online status and either deliver the message immediately or add it to the queue. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features are working correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire application to ensure that all features have been implemented correctly and all tests are passing.

You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}], "message_hash": "959935ffe369b8e1ffa97f5f7773f398d6c31b1fa05dce5a1e29fa05f4777905"}
