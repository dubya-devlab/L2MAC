This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The dictionary should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database can store and retrieve user data correctly.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for user sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept user email and password, and store them in the mock database. The forgotten password recovery route should accept user email, generate a temporary password, and update the user's password in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the sign up and forgotten password recovery routes work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept user email and the new profile picture or status message, and update the user's profile picture or status message in the mock database. The privacy settings route should accept user email and the new privacy settings, and update the user's privacy settings in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings routes work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept user email and the contact's email, and update the user's blocked contacts list in the mock database. The group management routes should accept user email and the group details, and update the user's groups in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the block, unblock, and group management routes work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving text messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. The send and receive routes should accept user email, recipient email, and the message, and update the user's and recipient's messages in the mock database. The read receipts route should accept user email, recipient email, and the message id, and update the message's read status in the mock database. The encryption route should accept user email, recipient email, and the message, encrypt the message, and update the user's and recipient's messages in the mock database. The image sharing route should accept user email, recipient email, and the image, and update the user's and recipient's messages in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the send, receive, read receipts, encryption, and image sharing routes work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding and removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The create group chat route should accept user email and the group chat details, and update the user's group chats in the mock database. The add and remove participants routes should accept user email, group chat id, and the participant's email, and update the group chat's participants in the mock database. The admin roles and permissions route should accept user email, group chat id, and the admin roles and permissions, and update the group chat's admin roles and permissions in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the create group chat, add and remove participants, and admin roles and permissions routes work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and controlling who can see the status. The post image status route should accept user email and the image status, and update the user's image statuses in the mock database. The control who can see the status route should accept user email, image status id, and the visibility settings, and update the image status's visibility settings in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the post image status and control who can see the status routes work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement web application. This includes creating a web-based version of the application that is accessible from browsers. The web application should have the same functionality as the Flask application. Write tests to ensure that the web application works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a message queuing system for when the user is offline, and displaying online/offline status. The message queuing system should store messages in a queue when the user is offline, and send them once connectivity is restored. The online/offline status should be displayed based on the user's last activity. Write tests to ensure that the message queuing system and online/offline status display work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive test of the entire application. This includes testing all routes and functionalities, and ensuring that they work together as expected. Fix any bugs or issues that are found during testing. Also, write a requirements.txt file that lists all the packages and dependencies required to run the application."], "step": "Step 8: Implement web application.
