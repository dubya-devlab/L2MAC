This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The dictionary should have keys as user IDs and values as another dictionary containing user details such as email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and the 'users' dictionary is initialized as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept user details, generate a unique user ID, and store the details in the 'users' dictionary. The forgotten password recovery route should accept a user ID and return the corresponding password from the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the sign up and forgotten password recovery routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and updating privacy settings. Each route should accept a user ID and the corresponding detail to be updated, and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly. Write tests to ensure that the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking/unblocking contacts and managing groups. The block/unblock route should accept a user ID and a contact ID, and update the 'blocked contacts' list for the user in the 'users' dictionary. The group management route should accept a user ID, a group ID, and a list of contact IDs, and update the 'groups' list for the user in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the block/unblock and group management routes work as expected and the 'users' dictionary is updated correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving text messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. Each route should accept the necessary details (such as sender ID, receiver ID, message, etc.) and perform the corresponding action. Write tests to ensure that the messaging routes work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding/removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. Each route should accept the necessary details (such as group ID, participant IDs, admin IDs, etc.) and perform the corresponding action. Write tests to ensure that the group chat routes work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and controlling who can see the status. Each route should accept the necessary details (such as user ID, image, visibility settings, etc.) and perform the corresponding action. Write tests to ensure that the status/story routes work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a route for serving the web application. The route should return a HTML file that contains the user interface of the chat application. Write tests to ensure that the web application route works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a route for updating the online/offline status of a user, and a mechanism for queuing messages when the user is offline. The online/offline status route should accept a user ID and a status, and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly. The message queuing mechanism should store messages in a 'message queue' dictionary when the receiver is offline, and send the messages when the receiver comes online. Write tests to ensure that the online/offline status route and the message queuing mechanism work as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire application and make any necessary improvements. This includes optimizing the code, improving error handling, and enhancing security. Also, write comprehensive tests for the entire application to ensure that all features work together as expected. Run all tests and make sure they all pass."], "step": "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking/unblocking contacts and managing groups. The block/unblock route should accept a user ID and a contact ID, and update the 'blocked contacts' list for the user in the 'users' dictionary.

Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
