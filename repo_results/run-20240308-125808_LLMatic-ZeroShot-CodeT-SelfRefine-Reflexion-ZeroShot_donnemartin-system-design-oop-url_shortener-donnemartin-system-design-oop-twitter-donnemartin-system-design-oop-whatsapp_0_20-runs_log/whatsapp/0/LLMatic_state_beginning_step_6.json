structure of the application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The keys of this dictionary will be the user's email and the values will be another dictionary containing user details such as password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is functioning as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for user sign up and forgotten password recovery. For sign up, the route should accept a POST request with the user's email and password, and add the user to the 'users' dictionary. For password recovery, the route should accept a POST request with the user's email and send a password reset link to the email (for the purpose of this task, just return a message indicating that the link has been sent). Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that users are being added to the 'users' dictionary.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. These routes should accept POST requests with the relevant user details and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that user details are being updated in the 'users' dictionary.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking/unblocking contacts and for creating, editing, and managing groups. For blocking/unblocking contacts, the routes should accept POST requests with the user's email and the contact's email, and update the 'users' dictionary accordingly. For group management, create a 'groups' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing group information. The keys of this dictionary will be the group name and the values will be a list of user emails. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'users' and 'groups' dictionaries are being updated as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving text messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, and sharing images. For sending and receiving messages, create a 'messages' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing message information. The keys of this dictionary will be the sender's email and the values will be another dictionary containing the recipient's email and the message details. For read receipts, the message details should include a 'read' status that is updated when a message is received. For encryption, use a simple encryption algorithm to encrypt messages before they are stored in the 'messages' dictionary. For image sharing, allow messages to include an image URL. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'messages' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding or removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. For creating group chats, the route should accept a POST request with the group name, picture, and initial participants, and add the group to the 'groups' dictionary. For adding or removing participants, the routes should accept POST requests with the group name and the participant's email, and update the 'groups' dictionary accordingly. For admin roles and permissions, add an 'admins' list to each group in the 'groups' dictionary and create routes for adding and removing admins. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'groups' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and for updating status visibility settings. For posting statuses, create a 'statuses' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing status information. The keys of this dictionary will be the user's email and the values will be a list of status details. For status visibility, add a 'visibility' setting to each status that determines who can see the status. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'statuses' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a basic HTML template for the chat application and setting up routes for rendering the template. The template should include sections for displaying user profiles, contacts, groups, messages, and statuses. Write tests to ensure that the template is being rendered correctly and that the routes are working as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a 'queue' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing messages that are sent when the user is offline. The keys of this dictionary will be the sender's email and the values will be a list of message details. When a user comes online, the messages in their queue should be sent and removed from the queue. Also, add an 'online' status to each user in the 'users' dictionary and create routes for updating this status. Write tests to ensure that these features are working correctly and that the 'queue' and 'users' dictionaries are being updated as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, review all the code and tests to ensure that everything is working as expected. Run all the tests and fix any issues that arise. Also, check that all the requirements have been met and that the application provides all the specified features. Once everything is working correctly, the task is complete."], "step": "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and for updating status visibility settings. For posting statuses, create a 'statuses' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing status information.
