This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The dictionary should have keys as user IDs and values as another dictionary containing user details such as email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is functioning as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept user details, generate a unique user ID, and store the details in the 'users' dictionary. The forgotten password recovery route should accept a user ID and return the corresponding password from the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the sign up and forgotten password recovery routes are working as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The routes should accept a user ID and the new details, and update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings routes are working as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The routes should accept a user ID and the relevant details, and update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that the contact blocking, unblocking, and group management routes are working as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving text messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, sharing images, and supporting emojis, GIFs, and stickers. The routes should accept the relevant details and perform the necessary actions. Write tests to ensure that the messaging routes are working as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats with a name and picture, adding or removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The routes should accept the relevant details and perform the necessary actions. Write tests to ensure that the group chat routes are working as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses visible for a limited time, and for controlling who can see the status. The routes should accept the relevant details and perform the necessary actions. Write tests to ensure that the status/story routes are working as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a route for serving the web application, and ensuring that all the other routes are accessible from the web application. Write tests to ensure that the web application route is working as expected, and that all the other routes can be accessed from the web application.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a route for updating the online/offline status of a user, and for queuing messages when a user is offline. The route should accept the relevant details and perform the necessary actions. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode routes are working as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, review all the code to ensure that it is clean, efficient, and follows best practices. Also, run all the tests to ensure that they all pass. If any tests fail, debug the corresponding code and fix the issues. Once all the tests pass, the implementation of the Global Chat Service is complete."], "step": "Step 4: Implement the contact management features.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
