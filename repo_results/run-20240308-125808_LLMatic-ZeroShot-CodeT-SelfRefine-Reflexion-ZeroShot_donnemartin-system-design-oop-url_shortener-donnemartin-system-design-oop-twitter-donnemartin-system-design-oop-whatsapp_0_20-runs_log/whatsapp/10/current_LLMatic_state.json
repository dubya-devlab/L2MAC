This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The dictionary should have keys as user IDs and values as another dictionary containing user details such as email, password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is functioning as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept an email and password, generate a unique user ID, and store these details in the 'users' dictionary. The forgotten password recovery route should accept an email, check if a user with that email exists, and if so, return the associated password. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning correctly and that user details are being stored and retrieved as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept a user ID and the new picture or message, and update the corresponding user's details in the 'users' dictionary. The privacy settings route should accept a user ID and the new settings, and update the corresponding user's details. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning correctly and that user details are being updated as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should accept a user ID and a contact ID, and update the corresponding user's blocked contacts in the 'users' dictionary. The group routes should accept a user ID and group details, and update the corresponding user's groups. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning correctly and that user details are being updated as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving text messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, sharing images, and supporting emojis, GIFs, and stickers. The message routes should accept a sender ID, a receiver ID, and a message, and store these details in a 'messages' dictionary. The read receipt, encryption, image sharing, and emoji support routes should modify the messages in the 'messages' dictionary as necessary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning correctly and that messages are being stored and modified as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, adding or removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. The group chat routes should accept a user ID, a group ID, and any necessary details, and update the corresponding group's details in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning correctly and that group details are being updated as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and controlling who can see the status. The status routes should accept a user ID, an image, and visibility settings, and store these details in a 'statuses' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning correctly and that statuses are being stored as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a route for accessing the application from a browser. The route should return a web page that allows users to interact with the application. Write tests to ensure that this route is functioning correctly and that the web page is being returned as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a route for updating a user's online/offline status, and modifying the message sending route to queue messages when the receiver is offline. The online/offline status route should accept a user ID and a status, and update the corresponding user's status in the 'users' dictionary. The message sending route should check the receiver's status before sending a message, and if the receiver is offline, store the message in a 'queued_messages' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning correctly and that user and message details are being updated as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, review all the code and tests to ensure that everything is functioning as expected.
