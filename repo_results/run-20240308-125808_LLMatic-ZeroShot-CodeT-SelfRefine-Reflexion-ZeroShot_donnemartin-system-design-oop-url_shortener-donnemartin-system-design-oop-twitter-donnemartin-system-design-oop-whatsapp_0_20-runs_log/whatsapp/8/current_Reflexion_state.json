The main reason for this is that the task was quite large and complex, requiring the implementation of a full-featured chat application with user registration, profile management, contact management, messaging, group chats, status/story feature, web application, and offline mode. The generated code only implemented user registration and the ability to join and leave chats.\n\nTo mitigate this, a new plan could involve breaking down the task into smaller, more manageable parts. Each part could focus on implementing a specific feature of the chat application. For example, one part could focus on user registration and authentication, another part could focus on user profile management, and so on. This would make the task more manageable and increase the likelihood of implementing all the specified features. Additionally, more time could be allocated to each part to ensure that the implementation is thorough and robust.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response.
