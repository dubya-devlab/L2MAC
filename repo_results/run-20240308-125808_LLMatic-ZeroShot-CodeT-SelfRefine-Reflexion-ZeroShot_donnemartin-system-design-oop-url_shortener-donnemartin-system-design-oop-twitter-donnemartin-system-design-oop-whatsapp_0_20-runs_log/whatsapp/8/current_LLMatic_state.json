Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is functioning as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for signing up and forgotten password recovery. The sign-up route should take an email and password, and add a new entry to the 'users' dictionary. The forgotten password recovery route should take an email and return the associated password. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. These routes should update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features.

Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving text messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, sharing images, and supporting emojis, GIFs, and stickers. These routes should update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats with a name and picture, adding or removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. These routes should update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses visible for a limited time and controlling who can see the status. These routes should update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a route for accessing the application from a browser. Write tests to ensure that this route is functioning correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a route for displaying the online/offline status of a user, and implementing message queuing for when the user is offline.
