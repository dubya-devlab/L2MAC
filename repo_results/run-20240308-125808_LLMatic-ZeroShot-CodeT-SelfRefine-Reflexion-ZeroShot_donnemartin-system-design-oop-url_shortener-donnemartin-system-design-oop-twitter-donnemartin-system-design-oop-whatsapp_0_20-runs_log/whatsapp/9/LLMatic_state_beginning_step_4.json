Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication system. This will involve creating a User class with attributes such as email and password. The User class should also have methods for password hashing and checking hashed passwords.

The login route should check the provided credentials against the stored user data. Write tests to ensure that the registration and login functionality works as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the forgotten password recovery feature. This will involve generating a secure token when a user requests password recovery. The token should be sent to the user's email. Create a route in the Flask application for password recovery. This route should generate a token and mock the process of sending it via email. Write tests to ensure that the password recovery functionality works as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the user profile feature. This will involve adding more attributes to the User class, such as profile picture and status message. Create routes in the Flask application for setting and updating these attributes. Write tests to ensure that the user profile functionality works as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the contact management feature. This will involve creating a Contact class with attributes such as blocked status. The User class should have a method for blocking and unblocking contacts. Create routes in the Flask application for managing contacts. Write tests to ensure that the contact management functionality works as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the messaging feature. This will involve creating a Message class with attributes such as sender, recipient, content, and read status. The User class should have methods for sending and receiving messages. Create routes in the Flask application for sending and receiving messages. Write tests to ensure that the messaging functionality works as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the group chat feature. This will involve creating a Group class with attributes such as name, picture, and participants. The User class should have methods for creating groups, adding participants, and sending messages to groups. Create routes in the Flask application for managing groups. Write tests to ensure that the group chat functionality works as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the status/story feature. This will involve creating a Status class with attributes such as content and visibility. The User class should have methods for posting and viewing statuses. Create routes in the Flask application for managing statuses. Write tests to ensure that the status/story functionality works as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the web application feature. This will involve setting up the Flask application to serve a web interface. The web interface should provide forms for user registration, login, and all the other features of the application. Write tests to ensure that the web application functionality works as expected.", "Step 10: Implement the connectivity and offline mode feature. This will involve adding a connectivity status attribute to the User class. The User class should also have a message queue for storing messages when offline.

Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
