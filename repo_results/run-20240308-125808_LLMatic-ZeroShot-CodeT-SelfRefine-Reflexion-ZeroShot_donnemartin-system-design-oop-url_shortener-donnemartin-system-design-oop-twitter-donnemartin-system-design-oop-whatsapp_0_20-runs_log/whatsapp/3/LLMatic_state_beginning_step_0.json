This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'mock_db.py' file to simulate a database using an in-memory dictionary. This file should include functions to add, update, delete, and retrieve data. After setting up the basic structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the mock database functions work as expected.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating a User class in a 'user.py' file with attributes such as email, password, and other necessary details. In the 'app.py' file, create routes for user registration and login. The registration route should add a new user to the mock database, while the login route should authenticate a user based on their email and password. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that user registration and login work correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile feature. This includes allowing users to set profile pictures and status messages, and setting privacy settings. Add methods to the User class to set and get these attributes. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file to handle these operations. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the user profile features work correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management feature. This includes blocking/unblocking contacts and managing groups. Create a Contact class in a 'contact.py' file with necessary attributes and methods. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file to handle these operations. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the contact management features work correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging feature. This includes sending and receiving real-time text messages, message read receipts, end-to-end encryption, image sharing, and support for emojis, GIFs, and stickers. Create a Message class in a 'message.py' file with necessary attributes and methods. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file to handle these operations. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the messaging features work correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat feature. This includes creating group chats, adding or removing participants, and setting admin roles and permissions. Create a GroupChat class in a 'group_chat.py' file with necessary attributes and methods. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file to handle these operations. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the group chat features work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes allowing users to post image statuses visible for a limited time and controlling who can see the status. Add methods to the User class to handle these operations. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file to handle these operations. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the status/story features work correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes making the chat service accessible from browsers. Use Flask's render_template function to serve HTML files for the different pages of the application. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the web application works correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode feature. This includes message queuing for when the user is offline and displaying online/offline status. Add methods to the User and Message classes to handle these operations. Also, create routes in the 'app.py' file to handle these operations. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode features work correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire application to ensure that all features have been implemented correctly. Run all tests to ensure that they all pass. If any tests fail, debug the application to fix the issues and then rerun the tests. Once all tests pass, the application is ready for deployment."], "step": "Step 1: Start by setting up the basic structure of the application.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
