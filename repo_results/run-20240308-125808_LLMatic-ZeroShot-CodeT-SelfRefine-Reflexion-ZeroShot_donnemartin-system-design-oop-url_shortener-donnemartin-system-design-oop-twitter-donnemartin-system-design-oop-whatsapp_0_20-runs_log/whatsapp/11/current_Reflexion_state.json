Many of the original features specified, such as forgotten password recovery, user profile settings, contact management, message read receipts, end-to-end encryption, image sharing, emojis, GIFs, and stickers support, group chats, status/story feature, web application, and connectivity and offline mode, are not implemented in the generated code. \n\nTo improve the implementation, a new plan should include the development of additional classes and methods to handle the missing features. For example, a Profile class could be created to handle user profile settings, a Contact class for contact management, and additional methods in the Message class for handling read receipts, encryption, and media sharing. Group chats could be handled by extending the Chat class, and a Status class could be created for the status/story feature. The Flask application could be extended to handle web requests, and additional logic could be added to handle message queuing and online/offline status. \n\nIn addition, the test coverage could be improved by adding tests for these new features. This would help ensure that the code is functioning as expected and catch any potential issues early in the development process.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests.
