This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The keys of this dictionary will be the user's email and the values will be another dictionary containing the user's password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is functioning as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for signing up and logging in. The sign-up route should take an email and password, and add a new entry to the 'users' dictionary. The login route should take an email and password, and check if they match an entry in the 'users' dictionary. Also, implement a forgotten password recovery feature. This can be a route that takes an email and returns the associated password. Write tests to ensure that these features are working correctly.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting a profile picture and a status message, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message can be stored as strings in the user's dictionary entry, and the privacy settings can be a dictionary with keys for 'details' and 'last seen' and boolean values. Write tests to ensure that these features are working correctly.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The blocked contacts can be a list in the user's dictionary entry, and the groups can be another dictionary with group names as keys and lists of members as values. Write tests to ensure that these features are working correctly.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving messages, for marking messages as read, and for encrypting and decrypting messages. The messages can be stored in a 'messages' dictionary with conversation IDs as keys and lists of messages as values. Each message can be another dictionary with keys for 'sender', 'receiver', 'content', 'read', and 'encrypted'. Write tests to ensure that these features are working correctly.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats, for adding and removing participants, and for setting admin roles and permissions. The group chats can be entries in the 'groups' dictionary in the user's dictionary entry, and the admin roles and permissions can be another dictionary within each group chat entry. Write tests to ensure that these features are working correctly.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses and for controlling who can see the status. The image statuses can be stored in a 'statuses' dictionary with user emails as keys and lists of statuses as values. Each status can be another dictionary with keys for 'image', 'visibility', and 'expiry'. Write tests to ensure that these features are working correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a route for accessing the application from a browser. This route should return a HTML page with a user interface for the chat application. Write tests to ensure that this feature is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a route for checking the online/offline status of a user, and for queuing messages when the user is offline. The online/offline status can be a boolean in the user's dictionary entry, and the queued messages can be a list in the 'messages' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these features are working correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, review all the code and tests to ensure that everything is working as expected. Run all the tests and fix any issues that come up. Also, make sure that the code follows best practices for Python and Flask, and that it is well-documented with comments explaining the more complex parts of the logic."], "step": "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature.

When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}], "message_hash": "3047e0f89314bee2f62334a2a301c01075b861ada9db12e7a8c126b427254a32"}
