Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"models/user.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tid: str\\n\\temail: str\\n\\tpassword: str\\n\\tprofile_picture: str = None\\n\\tstatus_message: str = None\\n\\tprivacy_settings: dict = None\\n\\tcontacts: list = None\\n\\n\\tdef update_profile_picture(self, new_picture):\\n\\t\\tself.profile_picture = new_picture\\n\\n\\tdef update_status_message(self, new_message):\\n\\t\\tself.status_message = new_message\\n\\n\\tdef update_privacy_settings(self, new_settings):\\n\\t\\tself.privacy_settings = new_settings\\n\\n\\tdef add_contact(self, contact):\\n\\t\\tif self.contacts is None:\\n\\t\\t\\tself.contacts = []\\n\\t\\tself.contacts.append(contact)\\n\\n\\tdef remove_contact(self, contact):\\n\\t\\tif self.contacts is not None and contact in self.contacts:\\n\\t\\t\\tself.contacts.remove(contact)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"models/chat.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Chat:\\n\\tid: str\\n\\tname: str\\n\\tmembers: list = None\\n\\tmessages: list = None\\n\\n\\tdef add_member(self, member):\\n\\t\\tif self.members is None:\\n\\t\\t\\tself.members = []\\n\\t\\tself.members.append(member)\\n\\n\\tdef remove_member(self, member):\\n\\t\\tif self.members is not None and member in self.members:\\n\\t\\t\\tself.members.remove(member)\\n\\n\\tdef add_message(self, message):\\n\\t\\tif self.messages is None:\\n\\t\\t\\tself.messages = []\\n\\t\\tself.messages.append(message)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request\\nfrom models.user import User\\nfrom models.chat import Chat\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\nusers = {}\\nchats = {}\\n\\n@app.route('/user', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_user():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = User(**data)\\n\\tusers[user.id] = user\\n\\treturn {'id': user.id}, 201\\n\\n@app.route('/user/<id>', methods=['GET'])\\ndef get_user(id):\\n\\tuser = users.get(id)\\n\\tif user is None:\\n\\t\\treturn {'error': 'User not found'}, 404\\n\\treturn user.__dict__, 200\\n\\n@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])\\ndef create_chat():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tchat = Chat(**data)\\n\\tchats[chat.id] = chat\\n\\treturn {'id': chat.id}, 201\\n\\n@app.route('/chat/<id>', methods=['GET'])\\ndef get_chat(id):\\n\\tchat = chats.get(id)\\n\\tif chat is None:\\n\\t\\treturn {'error': 'Chat not found'}, 404\\n\\treturn chat.__dict__, 200\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\n\\ndef test_create_user(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/user', json={'id': '1', 'email': 'test@test.com', 'password': 'test'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'id': '1'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_get_user(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/user/1')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'id': '1', 'email': 'test@test.com', 'password': 'test', 'profile_picture': None, 'status_message': None, 'privacy_settings': None, 'contacts': None}\\n\\n\\ndef test_create_chat(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/chat', json={'id': '1', 'name': 'Test Chat'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'id': '1'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_get_chat(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.get('/chat/1')\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'id': '1', 'name': 'Test Chat', 'members': None, 'messages': None}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "name": "write_files"}, "role": "assistant"}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"All tests passed.\"}"}]}
