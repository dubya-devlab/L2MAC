The main dependencies will be Flask for the web server, pytest for testing, and dataclasses for data management. Write a test to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and that the necessary dependencies are installed.", "Step 2: Implement the User Registration and Authentication features. This will involve creating a User class with attributes such as email and password. The sign up feature will involve adding a new user to a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). The forgotten password recovery feature will involve resetting the user's password. Write tests to ensure that the User class is functioning correctly and that the sign up and password recovery features are working as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the User Profile features. This will involve adding additional attributes to the User class such as profile picture and status message. The privacy settings feature will involve adding a privacy attribute to the User class which determines who can see the user's details or last seen status. Write tests to ensure that the User class is functioning correctly and that the profile picture, status message, and privacy settings features are working as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the Contact Management features. This will involve creating a Contact class with attributes such as blocked status. The block/unblock contacts feature will involve changing the blocked status of a contact. The create, edit, and manage groups feature will involve creating a Group class and adding methods to add and remove contacts from a group. Write tests to ensure that the Contact and Group classes are functioning correctly and that the block/unblock contacts and create, edit, and manage groups features are working as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the Messaging features. This will involve creating a Message class with attributes such as sender, receiver, content, read status, and encryption status. The send and receive real-time text messages feature will involve adding messages to a mock database (an in-memory dictionary). The message read receipts feature will involve changing the read status of a message. The end-to-end encryption feature will involve changing the encryption status of a message. The image sharing feature will involve adding an image attribute to the Message class. The emojis, GIFs, and stickers support feature will involve adding a method to the Message class to add emojis, GIFs, or stickers to a message. Write tests to ensure that the Message class is functioning correctly and that the send and receive real-time text messages, message read receipts, end-to-end encryption, image sharing, and emojis, GIFs, and stickers support features are working as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the Group Chats features. This will involve adding additional attributes to the Group class such as name and picture. The create group chats with a name and picture feature will involve creating a new group with a specified name and picture. The add or remove participants feature will involve adding or removing contacts from a group. The admin roles and permissions feature will involve adding an admin attribute to the Contact class and adding methods to the Group class to change the admin status of a contact. Write tests to ensure that the Group class is functioning correctly and that the create group chats with a name and picture, add or remove participants, and admin roles and permissions features are working as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the Status/Story Feature. This will involve creating a Status class with attributes such as user, image, and visibility. The allow users to post image statuses visible for a limited time feature will involve adding statuses to a mock database (an in-memory dictionary) and removing them after a specified time. The control who can see the status feature will involve adding a method to the Status class to change the visibility of a status. Write tests to ensure that the Status class is functioning correctly and that the allow users to post image statuses visible for a limited time and control who can see the status features are working as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the Web Application feature. This will involve setting up a Flask web server and creating routes for the various features of the application. Write tests to ensure that the web server is functioning correctly and that the routes are working as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the Connectivity and Offline Mode features. This will involve adding an online status attribute to the User class and a queue attribute to the Message class. The message queuing for when the user is offline feature will involve adding messages to the queue when the user is offline and sending them when the user is online. The display online/offline status feature will involve changing the online status of a user. Write tests to ensure that the User and Message classes are functioning correctly and that the message queuing for when the user is offline and display online/offline status features are working as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, review the entire codebase to ensure that everything is functioning as expected. Run all the tests to ensure that all features are working correctly. If any tests fail, debug the code and fix the issues. Once all tests pass, the implementation of the Global Chat Service is complete."], "step": "Step 6: Implement the Group Chats features. This will involve adding additional attributes to the Group class such as name and picture. The create group chats with a name and picture feature will involve creating a new group with a specified name and picture. The add or remove participants feature will involve adding or removing contacts from a group. The admin roles and permissions feature will involve adding an admin attribute to the Contact class and adding methods to the Group class to change the admin status of a contact.

Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
