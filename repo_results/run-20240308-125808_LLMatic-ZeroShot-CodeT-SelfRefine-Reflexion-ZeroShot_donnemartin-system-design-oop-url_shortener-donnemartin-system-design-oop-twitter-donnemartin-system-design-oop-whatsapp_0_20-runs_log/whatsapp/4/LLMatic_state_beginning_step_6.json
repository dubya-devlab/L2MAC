["Step 1: Start by setting up the basic structure of the application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The keys of this dictionary will be the user's email and the values will be another dictionary containing the user's password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is functioning as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for signing up and forgotten password recovery. The sign-up route should take an email and password as input, store them in the 'users' dictionary, and return a success message. The forgotten password recovery route should take an email as input, check if it exists in the 'users' dictionary, and return the associated password. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should take an email, picture, and message as input respectively, update the corresponding fields in the 'users' dictionary, and return a success message. The privacy settings route should take an email and a privacy setting as input, update the corresponding field in the 'users' dictionary, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking/unblocking contacts and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block/unblock routes should take two emails as input, update the 'blocked contacts' field of the first email in the 'users' dictionary, and return a success message. The group routes should take an email, a group name, and a list of emails as input, update the 'groups' field of the first email in the 'users' dictionary, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving real-time text messages, for updating message read receipts, for encrypting and decrypting messages, and for sharing images. The message routes should take two emails and a message as input, update a 'messages' dictionary (which should be created in this step), and return a success message. The read receipt, encryption, and image sharing routes should function similarly. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats with a name and picture, for adding or removing participants, and for updating admin roles and permissions. The group chat routes should take an email, a group name, a picture, and a list of emails as input, update the 'groups' field of the first email in the 'users' dictionary, and return a success message. The participant and admin routes should function similarly. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses visible for a limited time and for controlling who can see the status. The status route should take an email, an image, and a time limit as input, update a 'statuses' dictionary (which should be created in this step), and return a success message. The visibility route should take an email and a list of emails as input, update the 'statuses' dictionary, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a route for accessing the application from a browser. The web application route should return a webpage that allows users to interact with all the features of the application. Write tests to ensure that this route is functioning as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a route for updating the online/offline status of a user and for queuing messages when a user is offline. The online/offline route should take an email and a status as input, update the 'users' dictionary, and return a success message. The message queuing route should function similarly to the message sending route from step 5, but it should also check the online status of the recipient and queue the message if they are offline. Write tests to ensure that these routes are functioning as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, review all the code and tests to ensure that everything is functioning as expected. Run all the tests and fix any issues that arise. Once all the tests are passing, the application is ready to be deployed."], "step": "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses visible for a limited time and for controlling who can see the status. The status route should take an email, an image, and a time limit as input, update a 'statuses' dictionary (which should be created in this step), and return a success message.
