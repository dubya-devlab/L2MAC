basic structure of the application. This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a 'users' dictionary to act as a mock database for storing user information. The keys of this dictionary will be the user's email and the values will be another dictionary containing user details such as password, profile picture, status message, privacy settings, blocked contacts, and groups. Write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is functioning as expected.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication features. This includes creating routes for sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept an email and password, and add a new entry to the 'users' dictionary. The forgotten password recovery route should accept an email and return the corresponding password from the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the user profile features. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. These routes should update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the contact management features. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. These routes should update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the messaging features. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving text messages, updating read receipts, encrypting messages, sharing images, and supporting emojis, GIFs, and stickers. These routes should update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the group chat features. This includes creating routes for creating group chats with a name and picture, adding or removing participants, and managing admin roles and permissions. These routes should update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses visible for a limited time and controlling who can see the status. These routes should update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these routes are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the web application feature. This includes creating a route for accessing the application from a browser. Write tests to ensure that this route is working correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the connectivity and offline mode features. This includes creating a route for displaying online/offline status and a mechanism for queuing messages when the user is offline. These features should update the corresponding entries in the 'users' dictionary. Write tests to ensure that these features are working correctly and that the 'users' dictionary is being updated as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, review all the code and tests to ensure that everything is working as expected. Run all the tests and make sure they all pass. If any tests fail, debug the corresponding code and fix the issues.
