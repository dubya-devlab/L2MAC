Implement methods for user registration (sign up) and password recovery. The sign-up method should take in an email and password, and add a new user to the in-memory database (mocked as a dictionary). The password recovery method should simulate the process of sending a password recovery link to the user's email. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that a user can be successfully registered and that the password recovery process works as expected.", "Step 2: User Profile: Extend the User class to include profile-related attributes such as profile picture and status message. Implement methods to set these attributes. Also, add a privacy setting attribute that determines who can see the user's details or last seen status. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that the user's profile can be successfully updated and that the privacy settings work as expected.", "Step 3: Contact Management: Create a Contact class with attributes such as contact name and blocked status. Implement methods to block and unblock contacts. Also, create a Group class with attributes such as group name and list of members. Implement methods to create, edit, and manage groups. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that contacts can be successfully blocked/unblocked and that groups can be successfully created, edited, and managed.", "Step 4: Messaging: Create a Message class with attributes such as sender, receiver, content, read receipt status, and encryption status. Implement methods to send and receive messages, update read receipt status, and encrypt/decrypt messages. Also, extend the Message class to support image sharing and emojis, GIFs, and stickers. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that messages can be successfully sent and received, that read receipts are updated correctly, and that encryption works as expected.", "Step 5: Group Chats: Extend the Group class to include a group chat attribute, which is a list of Messages. Implement methods to add or remove participants and to assign admin roles and permissions. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that group chats function correctly, that participants can be added or removed, and that admin roles and permissions are assigned correctly.", "Step 6: Status/Story Feature: Extend the User class to include a status attribute, which is a list of Status objects. A Status object has attributes such as content (image), visibility duration, and visibility settings. Implement methods to post a new status and to control who can see the status. After implementing these methods, write tests to ensure that statuses can be successfully posted and that the visibility settings work as expected.", "Step 7: Web Application: Create a Flask application that provides a web interface for the chat service. Implement routes for user registration, login, profile management, contact management, messaging, group chats, and status posting. After implementing these routes, write tests to ensure that the web application works as expected.", "Step 8: Connectivity and Offline Mode: Implement a feature that queues messages when the user is offline and sends them once connectivity is restored. Also, add an online/offline status attribute to the User class and implement methods to update and display this status. After implementing these features, write tests to ensure that the message queuing and online/offline status display work as expected.", "Step 9: Integration Testing: After implementing all the features, perform integration testing to ensure that the entire system works together as expected. Write tests that simulate user interactions with the system, such as registering, logging in, sending messages, creating groups, posting statuses, and going offline/online.", "Step 10: Final Review and Refactoring: Review the entire codebase for any potential issues or improvements. Refactor the code as necessary to improve readability, efficiency, or adherence to best practices. Run all tests again to ensure that everything still works as expected after the refactoring."], "step": "Step 4: Messaging: Create a Message class with attributes such as sender, receiver, content, read receipt status, and encryption status.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
