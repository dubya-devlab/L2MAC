The other features such as user profile management, contact management, messaging, group chats, status/story feature, web application, and connectivity and offline mode were not implemented. \n\nThe possible reason for this discrepancy could be that the task was too large to be completed in a single step. Implementing a real-time chat application with all the specified features is a complex task that requires careful planning and execution. \n\nTo mitigate this, a new plan could be to break down the task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. Each sub-task would focus on implementing a specific feature of the chat application. After each sub-task is completed, tests would be written and run to ensure that the feature works as expected. This approach would make the task more manageable and increase the chances of successfully implementing all the specified features.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests.
