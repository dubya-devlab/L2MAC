This includes creating the main application file (app.py) and setting up a Flask application. Also, create a mock database using an in-memory dictionary to store user data. The database should be able to store user information such as email, password, profile picture, status message, and privacy settings. Write tests to ensure that the database can correctly store and retrieve user data.", "Step 2: Implement user registration and authentication. This includes creating routes for user sign up and forgotten password recovery. The sign up route should accept user email and password, and store them in the database. The forgotten password recovery route should allow users to reset their password. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication system works correctly.", "Step 3: Implement user profile management. This includes creating routes for setting profile pictures and status messages, and for updating privacy settings. The profile picture and status message routes should accept the respective data and update the user's profile in the database. The privacy settings route should allow users to control who can see their details or last seen status. Write tests to ensure that the profile management system works correctly.", "Step 4: Implement contact management. This includes creating routes for blocking and unblocking contacts, and for creating, editing, and managing groups. The block and unblock routes should update the user's contact list in the database. The group management routes should allow users to create groups, add or remove members, and assign admin roles and permissions. Write tests to ensure that the contact management system works correctly.", "Step 5: Implement messaging. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving real-time text messages, for displaying message read receipts, and for encrypting messages. The message routes should update the conversation history in the database. The read receipt route should update the status of messages in the database. The encryption route should ensure that messages are securely transmitted. Write tests to ensure that the messaging system works correctly.", "Step 6: Implement image sharing, emojis, GIFs, and stickers support. This includes creating routes for sending and receiving images, and for sending emojis, GIFs, and stickers. The image route should update the conversation history in the database. The emoji, GIF, and sticker routes should allow users to send these types of content in their messages. Write tests to ensure that the image sharing and content support systems work correctly.", "Step 7: Implement group chats. This includes creating routes for creating group chats with a name and picture, for adding or removing participants, and for assigning admin roles and permissions. The group chat routes should update the group chat data in the database. Write tests to ensure that the group chat system works correctly.", "Step 8: Implement the status/story feature. This includes creating routes for posting image statuses visible for a limited time, and for controlling who can see the status. The status route should update the user's status in the database. The visibility control route should update the user's privacy settings in the database. Write tests to ensure that the status/story feature works correctly.", "Step 9: Implement the web application. This includes creating a web-based version of the chat application that is accessible from browsers. The web application should provide all the features of the chat application, including user registration and authentication, profile management, contact management, messaging, group chats, and the status/story feature. Write tests to ensure that the web application works correctly.", "Step 10: Implement connectivity and offline mode. This includes creating a system for queuing messages when the user is offline, and for displaying online/offline status. The message queuing system should store unsent messages in the database and send them once connectivity is restored. The online/offline status system should update the user's status in the database. Write tests to ensure that the connectivity and offline mode systems work correctly."], "step": "Step 10: Implement connectivity and offline mode.
