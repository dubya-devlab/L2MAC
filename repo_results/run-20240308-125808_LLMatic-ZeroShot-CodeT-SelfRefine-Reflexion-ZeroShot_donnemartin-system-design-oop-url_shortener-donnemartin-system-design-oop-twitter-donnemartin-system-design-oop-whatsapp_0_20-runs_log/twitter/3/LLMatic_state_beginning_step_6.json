["1. **Setup the project structure and environment:** Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. The project will need the following files and directories: `app.py` (the main application file), `models.py` (for the data models), `views.py` (for the routes and views), `tests/` (a directory for the test files), and `requirements.txt` (for the project dependencies). Install the necessary dependencies such as Flask, pytest, and PyJWT. Write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and the necessary dependencies are installed.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication system. In the `models.py` file, define a User model with fields for email, username, and password. Implement the registration route in the `views.py` file. The route should accept a POST request with the user's email, username, and password, create a new user, and return a success message. Implement the authentication route. The route should accept a POST request with the user's email and password, verify the credentials, and return a JWT token. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication system works correctly.", "3. **Password Reset:** Implement the password reset feature. Add a route in the `views.py` file that accepts a POST request with the user's email. The route should generate a password reset token and return it. Add another route that accepts a POST request with the password reset token and the new password. The route should verify the token, reset the user's password, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the password reset feature works correctly.", "4. **Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. In the `models.py` file, add fields to the User model for the profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Add a route in the `views.py` file that accepts a PUT request with the user's JWT token and the new profile information. The route should update the user's profile and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the profile management feature works correctly.", "5. **Creating and Deleting Posts:** Implement the feature for creating and deleting posts. Define a Post model in the `models.py` file with fields for the user, text, and images. Add a route in the `views.py` file that accepts a POST request with the user's JWT token, the post text, and the images. The route should create a new post and return a success message. Add another route that accepts a DELETE request with the user's JWT token and the post id. The route should delete the post and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the feature for creating and deleting posts works correctly.", "6. **Interacting with Posts:** Implement the feature for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts. Define models for Like, Retweet, and Reply in the `models.py` file. Add routes in the `views.py` file for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts. Each route should accept a POST request with the user's JWT token and the post id, perform the corresponding action, and return a success message. Write tests to ensure that the feature for interacting with posts works correctly.", "7. **Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the feature for searching for posts and users and filtering posts. Add a route in the `views.py` file that accepts a GET request with a search query. The route should return the posts and users that match the query. Add another route that accepts a GET request with a filter type (hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics) and a filter value. The route should return the posts that match the filter. Write tests to ensure that the feature for content filtering and search works correctly.", "8. **Following & Followers:** Implement the feature for following and unfollowing users and viewing the timeline. Define a Follow model in the `models.py` file. Add routes in the `views.py` file for following and unfollowing users. Each route should accept a POST request with the user's JWT token and the other user's id, perform the corresponding action, and return a success message. Add another route that accepts a GET request with the user's JWT token. The route should return the posts from the users that the user follows. Write tests to ensure that the feature for following and unfollowing users and viewing the timeline works correctly.", "9. **Direct Messaging:** Implement the feature for direct messaging between users. Define a Message model in the `models.py` file. Add a route in the `views.py` file that accepts a POST request with the user's JWT token, the other user's id, and the message text. The route should create a new message and return a success message. Add another route that accepts a GET request with the user's JWT token. The route should return the user's messages. Write tests to ensure that the feature for direct messaging works correctly.", "10. **Trending & Discovery:** Implement the feature for identifying and displaying trending topics and recommending users to follow. Add a route in the `views.py` file that accepts a GET request. The route should return the trending topics based on the volume and velocity of mentions. Add another route that accepts a GET request with the user's JWT token. The route should return the users recommended for the user to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write tests to ensure that the feature for trending and discovery works correctly."], "step": "7. **Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the feature for searching for posts and users and filtering posts.
