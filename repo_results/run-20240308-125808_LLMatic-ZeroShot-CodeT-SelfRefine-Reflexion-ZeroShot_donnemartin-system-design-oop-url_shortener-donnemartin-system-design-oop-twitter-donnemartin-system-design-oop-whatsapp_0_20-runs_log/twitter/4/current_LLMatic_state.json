You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided.

The project will be a Flask application, so create an 'app.py' file for the application entry point. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to list all the necessary dependencies. The dependencies will include Flask, Pytest, itsdangerous (for JWT), and Pillow (for image handling). Create a 'models.py' file to define the data models for the application. The models will include User, Post, Comment, Message, Notification, and TrendingTopic. Each model will have appropriate fields according to the requirements. Create a 'services.py' file to define the business logic for the application. The services will include user management, post management, social interaction, and trending & discovery. Create a 'routes.py' file to define the routes for the application. The routes will include routes for user registration, login, profile management, creating posts, interacting with posts, following users, direct messaging, and viewing trending topics. Finally, create a 'tests' directory to hold all the test files. Each file in the 'tests' directory will correspond to a file in the main directory and will contain tests for the functions and methods defined in that file. After setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files, run tests to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and that all the necessary files exist.", "Step 2: Define the User model in the 'models.py' file. The User model will have fields for id, email, username, password, profile picture, bio, website link, location, and a flag for whether the profile is private or public. Also, define methods for password hashing and verification, and for generating and verifying JWT tokens. After defining the User model, write tests for the User model in the 'tests/test_models.py' file. The tests should check that a User instance can be created, that the password hashing and verification work correctly, and that the JWT token generation and verification work correctly. Run the tests to ensure that the User model is defined correctly.", "Step 3: Define the Post model in the 'models.py' file. The Post model will have fields for id, user_id (the id of the user who created the post), text (the content of the post), image (an optional image included in the post), and timestamp (the time when the post was created). Also, define methods for creating, deleting, and liking posts. After defining the Post model, write tests for the Post model in the 'tests/test_models.py' file. The tests should check that a Post instance can be created, that a post can be deleted, and that a post can be liked. Run the tests to ensure that the Post model is defined correctly.", "Step 4: Define the Comment model in the 'models.py' file. The Comment model will have fields for id, user_id (the id of the user who created the comment), post_id (the id of the post the comment is on), text (the content of the comment), and timestamp (the time when the comment was created). Also, define methods for creating and deleting comments. After defining the Comment model, write tests for the Comment model in the 'tests/test_models.py' file. The tests should check that a Comment instance can be created and that a comment can be deleted. Run the tests to ensure that the Comment model is defined correctly.", "Step 5: Define the Message model in the 'models.py' file. The Message model will have fields for id, sender_id (the id of the user who sent the message), receiver_id (the id of the user who received the message), text (the content of the message), and timestamp (the time when the message was sent). Also, define methods for sending and deleting messages. After defining the Message model, write tests for the Message model in the 'tests/test_models.py' file. The tests should check that a Message instance can be created and that a message can be deleted. Run the tests to ensure that the Message model is defined correctly.", "Step 6: Define the Notification model in the 'models.py' file. The Notification model will have fields for id, user_id (the id of the user who will receive the notification), type (the type of the notification, e.g., 'like', 'retweet', 'reply', 'mention', 'follow', 'message'), and timestamp (the time when the notification was created). Also, define a method for creating notifications. After defining the Notification model, write tests for the Notification model in the 'tests/test_models.py' file. The tests should check that a Notification instance can be created. Run the tests to ensure that the Notification model is defined correctly.", "Step 7: Define the TrendingTopic model in the 'models.py' file. The TrendingTopic model will have fields for id, hashtag (the hashtag that is trending), count (the number of times the hashtag has been mentioned), and timestamp (the time when the hashtag started trending). Also, define a method for updating the count of a trending topic. After defining the TrendingTopic model, write tests for the TrendingTopic model in the 'tests/test_models.py' file. The tests should check that a TrendingTopic instance can be created and that the count of a trending topic can be updated. Run the tests to ensure that the TrendingTopic model is defined correctly.", "Step 8: Define the services in the 'services.py' file. The services will include functions for user registration, login, password reset, profile editing, post creation, post deletion, post liking, comment creation, comment deletion, user following, user unfollowing, message sending, message deletion, notification creation, and trending topic updating. After defining the services, write tests for the services in the 'tests/test_services.py' file. The tests should check that each service function works correctly. Run the tests to ensure that the services are defined correctly.", "Step 9: Define the routes in the 'routes.py' file. The routes will include routes for user registration, login, password reset, profile editing, post creation, post deletion, post liking, comment creation, comment deletion, user following, user unfollowing, message sending, message deletion, notification viewing, and trending topic viewing. After defining the routes, write tests for the routes in the 'tests/test_routes.py' file. The tests should check that each route works correctly. Run the tests to ensure that the routes are defined correctly.", "Step 10: Finally, integrate all the components in the 'app.py' file. Import the models, services, and routes, and set up the Flask application. Also, set up a command for running the tests.
