Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write tests to ensure that the project setup is correct and the necessary dependencies are installed.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store user data. Implement the registration route (/register) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with user data (email, username, password), create a new User object, and store it in the mock database. Implement the authentication feature. This involves creating a login route (/login) that accepts POST requests with username and password, verifies the credentials against the mock database, and returns a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication features work as expected.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile information (profile picture, bio, website link, location, and privacy setting). Also, create a route (/profile) in the Flask application for managing user profiles. This route should accept GET requests to retrieve profile information and PUT requests to update profile information. The route should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the profile management feature works as expected.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass with fields for post content, images, and author. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store post data. Implement a route (/post) in the Flask application for creating and deleting posts. This route should accept POST requests to create new posts and DELETE requests to delete existing posts. The route should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Implement the content interaction feature. This involves creating routes (/like, /retweet, /reply) for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts. These routes should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content interaction features work as expected.", "5. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves creating a route (/search) in the Flask application for searching posts and users. This route should accept GET requests with a query parameter for the search keyword. The route should return posts and users that match the search keyword. Also, implement a route (/filter) for filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. This route should accept GET requests with query parameters for the filter criteria. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search features work as expected.", "6. **Implement Following & Followers:** Implement the following and followers feature. This involves adding fields to the User dataclass for following and followers (both lists of User objects). Also, create routes (/follow, /unfollow) in the Flask application for following and unfollowing users. These routes should accept POST requests with the username of the user to follow or unfollow. The routes should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Implement a route (/timeline) for displaying the timeline of posts from followed users. This route should accept GET requests and use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the following and followers features work as expected.", "7. **Implement Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for message content, sender, and recipient. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store message data. Implement a route (/message) in the Flask application for sending and receiving messages. This route should accept POST requests to send new messages and GET requests to retrieve received messages. The route should use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging feature works as expected.", "8. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for notification content and recipient. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store notification data. Implement a route (/notifications) in the Flask application for retrieving notifications. This route should accept GET requests and use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the notifications feature works as expected.", "9. **Implement Trending Topics:** Implement the trending topics feature. This involves creating a function to identify trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. Also, create a route (/trending) in the Flask application for retrieving trending topics. This route should accept GET requests with optional query parameters for location. Write tests to ensure that the trending topics feature works as expected.", "10. **Implement User Recommendations:** Implement the user recommendations feature. This involves creating a function to recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Also, create a route (/recommendations) in the Flask application for retrieving user recommendations. This route should accept GET requests and use JWT authentication to identify the user. Write tests to ensure that the user recommendations feature works as expected."], "step": "1. **Setup the project structure and environment:** Start by setting up the project structure.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
