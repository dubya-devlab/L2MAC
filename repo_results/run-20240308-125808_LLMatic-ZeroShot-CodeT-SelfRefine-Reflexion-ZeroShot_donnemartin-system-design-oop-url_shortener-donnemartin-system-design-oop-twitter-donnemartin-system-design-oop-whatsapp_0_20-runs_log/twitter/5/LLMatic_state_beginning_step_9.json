Write a test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the user registration and authentication system. Create a `User` class in a file named `user.py` with attributes for email, username, and password. The password should be hashed for security. Add methods for registering a new user and authenticating a user. The authentication method should return a JWT if the username and password match a registered user. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication methods work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the profile management system. Add attributes to the `User` class for profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Add methods for editing these attributes. Also, add a method for toggling the profile's privacy setting.

Add attributes to the `User` class for the users that a user is following and the users that are following a user. Add methods for following and unfollowing users. Also, add a method for displaying a timeline view of posts from followed users. Write tests to ensure that the following and followers methods work as expected.", "Step 8: Implement the direct messaging system.

Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging methods work as expected.", "Step 9: Implement the notifications system. Add a `Notification` class in a file named `notification.py` with attributes for the user who will receive the notification and the event that triggered the notification. Add methods to the `User` class for sending notifications when a user likes, retweets, replies to, or mentions another user.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
