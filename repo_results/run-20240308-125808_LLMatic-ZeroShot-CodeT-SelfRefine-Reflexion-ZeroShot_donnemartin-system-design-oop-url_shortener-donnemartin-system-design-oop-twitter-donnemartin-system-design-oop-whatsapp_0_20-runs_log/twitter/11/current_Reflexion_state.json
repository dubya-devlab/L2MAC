If the metric is asking for a scalar value indicating the number of features implemented, I should provide that instead of the success status of the code generation. I should also ensure that the generated code implements all the features specified in the task.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\nfrom typing import Dict\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n# Mock database\\nusers = {}\\nposts = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tid: str\\n\\tusername: str\\n\\temail: str\\n\\tpassword: str\\n\\tprofile: Dict\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Post:\\n\\tid: str\\n\\tuser_id: str\\n\\tcontent: str\\n\\n@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])\\ndef register():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = User(**data)\\n\\tusers[user.id] = user\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'User registered successfully'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\\ndef login():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users.get(data.get('id'))\\n\\tif user and user.password == data.get('password'):\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Login successful'}), 200\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401\\n\\n@app.route('/post', methods=['POST'])\\ndef post():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tpost = Post(**data)\\n\\tposts[post.id] = post\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Post created successfully'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/like', methods=['POST'])\\ndef like():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tpost = posts.get(data.get('post_id'))\\n\\tif post:\\n\\t\\tpost.likes += 1\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Post liked'}), 200\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Post not found'}), 404\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nfrom flask import json\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\n\\ndef test_register(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/register', json={'id': '1', 'username': 'test', 'email': 'test@test.com', 'password': 'test', 'profile': {}})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert json.loads(response.data) == {'message': 'User registered successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_login(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/login', json={'id': '1', 'password': 'test'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert json.loads(response.data) == {'message': 'Login successful'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_post(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/post', json={'id': '1', 'user_id': '1', 'content': 'Hello, world!'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert json.loads(response.data) == {'message': 'Post created successfully'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_like(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/like', json={'post_id': '1'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert json.loads(response.data) == {'message': 'Post liked'}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "name": "write_files"}, "role": "assistant"}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.
