Start by setting up the project structure and creating the necessary files. The project will be a Flask application, so create an entry point file 'app.py'. Also, create a 'requirements.txt' file to manage the dependencies. The project will need Flask for the web framework, Pytest for testing, and PyJWT for handling JWT authentication. Write the necessary import statements in 'app.py' and list the dependencies in 'requirements.txt'. After setting up, run a basic test to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly.", "Step 2: Implement the User Management functionality. Create a 'user.py' file and define a User class with attributes for id, email, username, password, profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Also, create methods for registration, password reset, and profile editing. For the password, ensure it is hashed before storing. For JWT authentication, create a method to generate a JWT token upon successful login. After implementing, write tests to ensure that the User class methods work as expected.", "Step 3: Implement the Posting & Content Management functionality. Create a 'post.py' file and define a Post class with attributes for id, user_id, text, image, and timestamp. Also, create methods for creating, deleting, and interacting with posts (like, retweet, reply). For the nested comment structure, consider each reply as a new post with a reference to the parent post. After implementing, write tests to ensure that the Post class methods work as expected.", "Step 4: Implement the Content Filtering & Search functionality. In the 'post.py' file, create methods for searching posts or users using keywords and filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. Consider using a simple in-memory data structure to store the posts and perform the search and filter operations. After implementing, write tests to ensure that the search and filter methods work as expected.", "Step 5: Implement the Social Interaction functionality. In the 'user.py' file, create methods for following/unfollowing users, viewing a timeline of posts from followed users, and receiving notifications for new followers. Also, create methods for direct messaging between users and blocking/unblocking users from messaging. After implementing, write tests to ensure that the social interaction methods work as expected.", "Step 6: Implement the Notifications functionality. Create a 'notification.py' file and define a Notification class with attributes for id, user_id, post_id, and type (like, retweet, reply, mention). Also, create methods for creating and viewing notifications. After implementing, write tests to ensure that the Notification class methods work as expected.", "Step 7: Implement the Trending & Discovery functionality. In the 'post.py' file, create methods for identifying and displaying trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. Also, create methods for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. After implementing, write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery methods work as expected.", "Step 8: Integrate all the functionalities in the Flask application. In the 'app.py' file, define routes for each functionality (User Management, Posting & Content Management, Social Interaction, Notifications, Trending & Discovery). Use the methods defined in the User, Post, and Notification classes to handle the requests. After integrating, run the Flask application to ensure that it works as expected.", "Step 9: Write integration tests for the Flask application. Create a 'test_app.py' file and write tests for each route defined in the 'app.py' file. Use Pytest and its Flask plugin to write the tests. After writing, run the tests to ensure that all routes work as expected.", "Step 10: Perform a final review of the code and tests.
