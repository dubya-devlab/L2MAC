Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. The project will need the following files and directories: `app.py` (the main application file), `models.py` (for the data models), `views.py` (for the routes and views), `tests/` (a directory for the test files), and `requirements.txt` (for the project dependencies). Install the necessary dependencies such as Flask, pytest, and PyJWT. Write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and the necessary dependencies are installed.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication system. In the `models.py` file, define a User model with fields for email, username, and password. Implement the registration route in the `views.py` file that allows users to register with their email, username, and password. Implement the authentication route that checks the user's credentials and returns a JWT token if the credentials are correct. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication system works correctly.", "3. **Password Reset:** Implement the password reset feature. Add a route in the `views.py` file that allows users to request a password reset. This route should send an email to the user with a password reset link. Implement another route that allows users to reset their password using the link. Write tests to ensure that the password reset feature works correctly.", "4. **Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. Add fields to the User model for the profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Implement routes that allow users to view and edit their profile information. Add an option for users to make their profile private or public. Write tests to ensure that the profile management feature works correctly.", "5. **Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting and content management feature. Define a Post model with fields for the post content, images, and the user who created the post. Implement routes that allow users to create, view, and delete posts. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content management feature works correctly.", "6. **Interacting with Posts:** Implement the feature that allows users to interact with posts. Add fields to the Post model for likes, retweets, and replies. Implement routes that allow users to like, retweet, and reply to posts. Write tests to ensure that the interacting with posts feature works correctly.", "7. **Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. Add a route that allows users to search for specific posts or users using keywords. Implement a filter option based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search feature works correctly.", "8. **Social Interaction:** Implement the social interaction feature. Add fields to the User model for followers and following. Implement routes that allow users to follow/unfollow other users, view posts from followed users, and receive notifications for new followers. Implement the direct messaging feature by defining a Message model and adding routes for sending and receiving messages. Write tests to ensure that the social interaction feature works correctly.", "9. **Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. Add a Notification model and implement routes that notify users of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions. Write tests to ensure that the notifications feature works correctly.", "10. **Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending and discovery feature. Add a route that identifies and displays trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. Implement a user recommendation system that recommends users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery feature works correctly."], "step": "1. **Setup the project structure and environment:** Start by setting up the project structure.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
