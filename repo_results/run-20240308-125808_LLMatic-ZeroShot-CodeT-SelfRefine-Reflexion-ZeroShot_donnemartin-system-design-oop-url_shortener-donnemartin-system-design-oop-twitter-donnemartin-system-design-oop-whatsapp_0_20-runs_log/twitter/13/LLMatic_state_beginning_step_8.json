environment:** Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Finally, write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly set up and that all dependencies are installed.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store user data. Implement the registration route (/register) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with user data (email, username, password), create a new User object, and store it in the mock database. Implement the authentication feature. This involves creating a login route (/login) that accepts POST requests with username and password, verifies the credentials against the mock database, and returns a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication features work as expected.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile information (profile picture, bio, website link, location, and privacy setting). Also, create a route (/profile) in the Flask application for managing user profiles. This route should accept GET requests to retrieve profile information and PUT requests to update profile information. The route should verify the JWT token in the request to ensure that the user is authenticated and authorized to update the profile. Write tests to ensure that the profile management feature works as expected.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass with fields for post content, images, and user. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store post data. Implement the posting route (/post) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with post data (content, images), create a new Post object, and store it in the mock database. Implement the content management feature. This involves creating routes for liking posts (/like), retweeting posts (/retweet), and replying to posts (/reply). These routes should verify the JWT token in the request to ensure that the user is authenticated. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content management features work as expected.", "5. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves creating a route (/search) in the Flask application for searching posts and users. This route should accept GET requests with a query parameter for the search keyword. The route should return posts and users that match the search keyword. Also, implement a route (/filter) for filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. This route should accept GET requests with query parameters for the filter criteria. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search features work as expected.", "6. **Implement Following & Followers:** Implement the following and followers feature. This involves adding fields to the User dataclass for following and followers (both lists of User objects). Also, create routes in the Flask application for following users (/follow) and unfollowing users (/unfollow). These routes should accept POST requests with the username of the user to follow or unfollow. The routes should update the following and followers lists of the relevant User objects. Write tests to ensure that the following and followers features work as expected.", "7. **Implement Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for sender, recipient, and content. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store message data. Implement the messaging route (/message) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with message data (recipient, content), create a new Message object, and store it in the mock database. The route should verify the JWT token in the request to ensure that the user is authenticated and authorized to send the message. Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging feature works as expected.", "8. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for user, type (like, retweet, reply, mention, follow), and post or message. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store notification data. Implement the notifications route (/notifications) in the Flask application. This route should accept GET requests and return the notifications for the authenticated user. The route should verify the JWT token in the request to ensure that the user is authenticated. Write tests to ensure that the notifications feature works as expected.", "9. **Implement Trending Topics:** Implement the trending topics feature. This involves creating a function to identify trending hashtags or topics based on the volume and velocity of mentions in posts. Also, create a route (/trending) in the Flask application for retrieving trending topics. This route should accept GET requests and return the trending topics. Write tests to ensure that the trending topics feature works as expected.", "10. **Implement User Recommendations:** Implement the user recommendations feature. This involves creating a function to recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Also, create a route (/recommendations) in the Flask application for retrieving user recommendations. This route should accept GET requests and return the user recommendations for the authenticated user. The route should verify the JWT token in the request to ensure that the user is authenticated. Write tests to ensure that the user recommendations feature works as expected."], "step": "9. **Implement Trending Topics:** Implement the trending topics feature. This involves creating a function to identify trending hashtags or topics based on the volume and velocity of mentions in posts. Also, create a route (/trending) in the Flask application for retrieving trending topics. This route should accept GET requests and return the trending topics.

You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output.
