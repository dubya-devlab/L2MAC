project structure and environment:** Start by setting up the project structure. Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. This includes the main application file (app.py), a directory for templates (templates/), a directory for static files (static/), and a directory for tests (tests/). Also, create a requirements.txt file to manage Python dependencies. The dependencies should include Flask, pytest, and PyJWT for JWT authentication. After setting up the project structure, setup a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Finally, write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and the application runs without errors.", "2. **Implement User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration feature. This involves creating a User dataclass with fields for email, username, and password. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store user data. Implement the registration route (/register) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with user data (email, username, password), create a new User object, and store it in the mock database. Implement the authentication feature. This involves creating a login route (/login) that accepts POST requests with username and password, verifies the credentials against the mock database, and returns a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication features work as expected.", "3. **Implement Profile Management:** Implement the profile management feature. This involves adding additional fields to the User dataclass for profile information (profile picture, bio, website link, location, and profile visibility). Also, create a route (/profile) in the Flask application for managing user profiles. This route should accept GET requests to retrieve profile information and PUT requests to update profile information. The route should require JWT authentication. Write tests to ensure that the profile management feature works as expected.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature. This involves creating a Post dataclass with fields for post content, post images, and post author. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store post data. Implement the posting route (/post) in the Flask application. This route should accept POST requests with post data (content, images), create a new Post object, and store it in the mock database. The route should require JWT authentication. Implement the content management feature. This involves creating routes for deleting posts (/post/<id>/delete), liking posts (/post/<id>/like), retweeting posts (/post/<id>/retweet), and replying to posts (/post/<id>/reply). These routes should require JWT authentication. Write tests to ensure that the posting and content management features work as expected.", "5. **Implement Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search feature. This involves creating a route (/search) in the Flask application that accepts GET requests with search queries. The route should return posts or users that match the search query. Also, implement a filter feature that allows users to filter posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. This can be done by adding query parameters to the search route. Write tests to ensure that the content filtering and search feature works as expected.", "6. **Implement Social Interaction:** Implement the following and followers feature. This involves adding fields to the User dataclass for following and followers. Also, create routes in the Flask application for following users (/follow/<username>), unfollowing users (/unfollow/<username>), and viewing the timeline (/timeline). The timeline should display posts from followed users. Implement the direct messaging feature. This involves creating a Message dataclass with fields for message content and message participants. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store message data. Implement routes for sending messages (/message/<username>), viewing messages (/messages), and blocking users (/block/<username>). These routes should require JWT authentication. Write tests to ensure that the social interaction features work as expected.", "7. **Implement Notifications:** Implement the notifications feature. This involves creating a Notification dataclass with fields for notification content and notification recipient. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store notification data. Implement a route (/notifications) in the Flask application for viewing notifications. This route should require JWT authentication. Also, modify the routes for liking posts, retweeting posts, replying to posts, and following users to create notifications when these actions are performed. Write tests to ensure that the notifications feature works as expected.", "8. **Implement Trending Topics:** Implement the trending topics feature. This involves creating a TrendingTopic dataclass with fields for topic name, topic volume, and topic velocity. Also, create a mock database (a Python dictionary) to store trending topic data. Implement a route (/trending) in the Flask application for viewing trending topics. This route should accept GET requests and return a list of trending topics sorted by volume and velocity. The route should also accept query parameters for filtering trending topics based on location. Write tests to ensure that the trending topics feature works as expected.", "9. **Implement User Recommendations:** Implement the user recommendations feature. This involves creating a route (/recommendations) in the Flask application for viewing user recommendations. The route should accept GET requests and return a list of users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. The route should require JWT authentication. Write tests to ensure that the user recommendations feature works as expected.", "10. **Final Testing and Refactoring:** After implementing all the features, perform a final round of testing to ensure that all features work as expected and interact with each other correctly. This involves running all the tests written in the previous steps and fixing any issues that arise. Also, refactor the code to improve its structure and readability. Finally, write a test to ensure that the entire application works as expected."], "step": "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting feature.
