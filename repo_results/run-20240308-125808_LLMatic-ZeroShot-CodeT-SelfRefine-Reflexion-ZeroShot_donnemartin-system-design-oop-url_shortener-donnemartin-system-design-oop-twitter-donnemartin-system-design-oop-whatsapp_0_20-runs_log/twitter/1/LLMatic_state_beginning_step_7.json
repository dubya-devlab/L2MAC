Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. The project will need a main application file (app.py), a models file (models.py) to define the data models, a routes file (routes.py) to define the application routes, and a utilities file (utils.py) to hold utility functions. Also, create a tests directory to hold all the test files. Setup a virtual environment and install the necessary packages including Flask, pytest, and PyJWT. Create a requirements.txt file to list all the project dependencies. Write tests to ensure that the project structure is correctly setup and all the necessary packages are installed.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** In the models.py file, define a User model with fields for email, username, and password. In the routes.py file, create routes for user registration and authentication. The registration route should accept a POST request with the user's email, username, and password, create a new User instance, and store it in an in-memory dictionary acting as a mock database. The authentication route should accept a POST request with the user's email and password, verify the credentials against the stored User instances, and return a JWT token if the credentials are valid. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication routes are working correctly.", "3. **Password Reset:** Add a route in routes.py for password reset. This route should accept a POST request with the user's email, generate a password reset token, and return it in the response. Add another route to accept the password reset token and the new password, verify the token, and update the user's password. Write tests to ensure that the password reset functionality is working correctly.", "4. **Profile Management:** Add fields to the User model for profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Add a route in routes.py for updating the user profile. This route should accept a POST request with the JWT token and the new profile information, verify the token, and update the User instance. Write tests to ensure that the profile management functionality is working correctly.", "5. **Creating and Deleting Posts:** Define a Post model in models.py with fields for the post text, images, and the user who created the post. In routes.py, add routes for creating and deleting posts. The create post route should accept a POST request with the JWT token and the post information, verify the token, create a new Post instance, and store it in the mock database. The delete post route should accept a DELETE request with the JWT token and the post id, verify the token, and delete the corresponding Post instance. Write tests to ensure that the post creation and deletion functionality is working correctly.", "6. **Interacting with Posts:** Add fields to the Post model for likes, retweets, and replies. Each of these fields should be a list of User instances. Add routes in routes.py for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts. Each of these routes should accept a POST request with the JWT token and the post id, verify the token, and update the corresponding field in the Post instance. Write tests to ensure that the post interaction functionality is working correctly.", "7. **Content Filtering & Search:** Add a route in routes.py for searching posts and users. This route should accept a GET request with the search query, and return a list of Post and User instances that match the query. Write tests to ensure that the search functionality is working correctly.", "8. **Following & Followers:** Add fields to the User model for followers and following. Each of these fields should be a list of User instances. Add routes in routes.py for following and unfollowing users. Each of these routes should accept a POST request with the JWT token and the target user's id, verify the token, and update the corresponding field in the User instance. Write tests to ensure that the follow/unfollow functionality is working correctly.", "9. **Direct Messaging:** Define a Message model in models.py with fields for the sender, receiver, and the message text. Add a route in routes.py for sending messages. This route should accept a POST request with the JWT token, the receiver's id, and the message text, verify the token, create a new Message instance, and store it in the mock database. Write tests to ensure that the direct messaging functionality is working correctly.", "10. **Notifications:** Add a field to the User model for notifications. This field should be a list of Notification instances. Define a Notification model in models.py with fields for the notification type and the related post or user. Update the routes for liking, retweeting, replying to posts, and following users to create a new Notification instance and add it to the relevant User instance whenever these actions are performed. Write tests to ensure that the notification functionality is working correctly."], "step": "8. **Following & Followers:** Add fields to the User model for followers and following.
