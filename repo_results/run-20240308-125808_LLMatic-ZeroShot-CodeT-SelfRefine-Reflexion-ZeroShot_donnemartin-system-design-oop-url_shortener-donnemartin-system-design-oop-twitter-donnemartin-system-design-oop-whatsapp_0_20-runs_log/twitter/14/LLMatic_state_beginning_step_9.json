Use JWT or a similar protocol for secure authentication. For the mock database, use a dictionary where the keys are usernames and the values are `User` instances. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_user.py` to test the `User` class methods. Use the `pytest` library for writing the tests.", "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Add methods to the `User` class for editing profile information. These methods should allow a user to update their profile picture (`update_profile_picture`), bio (`update_bio`), website link (`update_website_link`), and location (`update_location`). Also, implement a method for toggling the privacy of a user's profile (`toggle_privacy`). After implementing these methods, update the `test_user.py` file to include tests for these new methods.", "3. **Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Create a `Post` class in a file named `post.py`.

Implement a nested comment structure for post replies. After implementing these methods, update the `test_post.py` file to include tests for these new methods.", "5. **Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement a `Search` class in a file named `search.py`. This class should have methods for searching for specific posts or users using keywords (`search_posts`, `search_users`), and filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics (`filter_posts`). After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_search.py` to test the `Search` class methods.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Add methods to the `User` class for following another user (`follow`), unfollowing a user (`unfollow`), and viewing a timeline of posts from followed users (`view_timeline`). Implement a notification system for new followers. After implementing these methods, update the `test_user.py` file to include tests for these new methods.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Implement a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender`, `receiver`, `text`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for sending a message (`send`), and blocking/unblocking users from messaging (`block_user`, `unblock_user`). The mock database for messages should be a dictionary where the keys are message IDs and the values are `Message` instances. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_message.py` to test the `Message` class methods.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Add methods to the `User` class for viewing notifications of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions (`view_notifications`). Implement a system for generating these notifications. After implementing these methods, update the `test_user.py` file to include tests for these new methods.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `Trending` class in a file named `trending.py`. This class should have methods for identifying and displaying trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions (`get_trending_topics`), and sorting trending topics based on location or globally (`sort_trending_topics`). After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_trending.py` to test the `Trending` class methods.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Add a method to the `User` class for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers (`recommend_users`).
