Use JWT or a similar protocol for secure authentication. For the mock database, use a dictionary where the keys are usernames and the values are `User` instances. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_user.py` to test the `User` class methods. Use the `pytest` library for writing the tests.", "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Add methods to the `User` class for editing profile information.

This class should have methods for searching for specific posts or users using keywords (`search_posts`, `search_users`), and filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics (`filter_posts`). After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_search.py` to test the `Search` class methods.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Add methods to the `User` class for following another user (`follow`), unfollowing a user (`unfollow`), and viewing a timeline of posts from followed users (`view_timeline`). Implement a notification system for new followers.

This class should have attributes for `sender`, `receiver`, `text`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for sending a message (`send`), and blocking/unblocking users from messaging (`block_user`, `unblock_user`). The mock database for messages should be a dictionary where the keys are message IDs and the values are `Message` instances. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_message.py` to test the `Message` class methods.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Add methods to the `User` class for viewing notifications of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions (`view_notifications`).

After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_trending.py` to test the `Trending` class methods.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Add a method to the `User` class for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers (`recommend_users`). After implementing this method, update the `test_user.py` file to include a test for this new method."], "step": "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Add methods to the `User` class for editing profile information.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
