This class should have attributes for `email`, `username`, `password`, and `is_private` (for profile privacy). Implement methods for registering a new user (`register`), authenticating a user (`authenticate`), and resetting a user's password (`reset_password`). Use JWT or a similar protocol for secure authentication. For the password, store only a hashed version for security reasons. For this step, mock a database with an in-memory dictionary to store user data. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_user.py` to ensure that user registration, authentication, and password resetting work as expected. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Add methods to the `User` class for editing profile information. These methods should allow a user to update their profile picture (`update_profile_picture`), bio (`update_bio`), website link (`update_website_link`), and location (`update_location`). Also, implement a method for toggling the privacy of a user's profile (`toggle_privacy`). After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for profile management. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "3. **Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Create a `Post` class in a file named `post.py`. This class should have attributes for `user_id`, `text`, `image`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for creating a new post (`create`), and deleting a post (`delete`). The `create` method should enforce a limit of 280 characters for the `text` attribute. For this step, mock a database with an in-memory dictionary to store post data. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_post.py` to ensure that post creation and deletion work as expected. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Add methods to the `Post` class for liking a post (`like`), retweeting a post (`retweet`), and replying to a post (`reply`). The `like` and `retweet` methods should update a count of likes and retweets, respectively. The `reply` method should create a new post that is linked to the original post. After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_post.py` to include tests for post interactions. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "5. **Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement a `Search` class in a file named `search.py`. This class should have methods for searching for specific posts or users using keywords (`search_posts`, `search_users`), and filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics (`filter_posts`). After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_search.py` to ensure that content filtering and search work as expected. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Add methods to the `User` class for following another user (`follow`), unfollowing a user (`unfollow`), and viewing a timeline of posts from followed users (`view_timeline`). The `follow` and `unfollow` methods should update a list of followed users and followers, respectively. The `view_timeline` method should return a list of `Post` objects from followed users, sorted by `timestamp`. After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for following and followers. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Implement a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender_id`, `receiver_id`, `text`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for sending a message (`send`) and blocking a user from sending messages (`block`). For this step, mock a database with an in-memory dictionary to store message data. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_message.py` to ensure that direct messaging works as expected. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Add methods to the `User` class for receiving notifications of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions (`receive_notification`). This method should update a list of notifications for the user. After implementing this method, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for notifications. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `Trending` class in a file named `trending.py`. This class should have methods for identifying and displaying trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions (`get_trending_topics`), and sorting trending topics based on location or globally (`sort_trending_topics`). After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_trending.py` to ensure that trending topics work as expected. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Add a method to the `User` class for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers (`recommend_users`). This method should return a list of `User` objects that the user might be interested in following. After implementing this method, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for user recommendations. Run these tests to confirm that they pass."], "step": "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Add methods to the `User` class for editing profile information. These methods should allow a user to update their profile picture (`update_profile_picture`), bio (`update_bio`), website link (`update_website_link`), and location (`update_location`). Also, implement a method for toggling the privacy of a user's profile (`toggle_privacy`). After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for profile management.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
