by creating a `User` class in a file named `user.py`. This class should have attributes for `email`, `username`, `password`, and `is_private` (for profile privacy). Implement methods for registering a new user (`register`), authenticating a user (`authenticate`), and resetting a user's password (`reset_password`). Use JWT or a similar protocol for secure authentication. For the password, store only a hashed version for security reasons. For this step, mock a database with an in-memory dictionary to store user data. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_user.py` to ensure that user registration, authentication, and password resetting work as expected. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Add methods to the `User` class for editing profile information. These methods should allow a user to update their profile picture (`update_profile_picture`), bio (`update_bio`), website link (`update_website_link`), and location (`update_location`). Also, implement a method for toggling the privacy of a user's profile (`toggle_privacy`). After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for profile management. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "3. **Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Create a `Post` class in a file named `post.py`. This class should have attributes for `user_id`, `text`, `image`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for creating a new post (`create`), and deleting a post (`delete`). The `create` method should enforce a limit of 280 characters for the `text` attribute. For this step, mock a database with an in-memory dictionary to store post data. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_post.py` to ensure that post creation and deletion work as expected. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Add methods to the `Post` class for liking a post (`like`), retweeting a post (`retweet`), and replying to a post (`reply`). The `like` and `retweet` methods should update a count of likes and retweets, respectively. The `reply` method should create a new post that is linked to the original post. After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_post.py` to include tests for post interactions. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "5. **Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement a `Search` class in a file named `search.py`. This class should have methods for searching for specific posts or users using keywords (`search_posts`, `search_users`), and filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics (`filter_posts`). After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_search.py` to ensure that content filtering and search work as expected. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Add methods to the `User` class for following another user (`follow`), unfollowing a user (`unfollow`), and viewing a timeline of posts from followed users (`view_timeline`). The `follow` and `unfollow` methods should update a list of followed users and followers, respectively. The `view_timeline` method should return a list of `Post` objects from followed users, sorted by `timestamp`. After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for following and followers. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Implement a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender_id`, `receiver_id`, `text`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for sending a message (`send`) and blocking a user from sending messages (`block`). For this step, mock a database with an in-memory dictionary to store message data. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_message.py` to ensure that direct messaging works as expected. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Add methods to the `User` class for receiving notifications of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions (`receive_notification`). This method should update a list of notifications for the user. After implementing this method, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for notifications. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `Trending` class in a file named `trending.py`. This class should have methods for identifying and displaying trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions (`get_trending_topics`), and sorting trending topics based on location or globally (`sort_trending_topics`). After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_trending.py` to ensure that trending topics work as expected. Run these tests to confirm that they pass.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Add a method to the `User` class for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers (`recommend_users`). This method should return a list of `User` objects that the user might be interested in following. After implementing this method, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for user recommendations. Run these tests to confirm that they pass."], "step": "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `Trending` class in a file named `trending.py`.

You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.\nYou always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.\nPlease always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.\nWhen writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.\n\nProvide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.\n\nYou cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.\n\nYou cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.\n                               \nIf a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.\n\nUse the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.\n"}], "message_hash": "1130f490cd19bb6cf13030ae71ef18908fbc6a99f30da0ea33905e66f641af5f"}
