Create a new Python Flask project and setup the necessary files and directories. The project will need a main application file (app.py), a configuration file (config.py), a models file (models.py) for the database models, a routes file (routes.py) for the application routes, and a utilities file (utils.py) for utility functions. Also, create a tests directory for all the test files. Make sure to create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages (Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-JWT-Extended, etc.). Also, create a requirements.txt file to keep track of the project dependencies. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the project setup is correct and all the necessary files and directories exist.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication functionality. In the models.py file, define a User model with fields for email, username, and password. Implement a registration route in the routes.py file that allows users to register using their email, username, and password. Also, implement an authentication route that authenticates users and returns a JWT token. Use the Flask-JWT-Extended package for handling JWT tokens. After implementing the registration and authentication functionality, write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication work correctly.", "3. **User Profile Management:** Implement the user profile management functionality. Add fields to the User model for profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Implement routes for editing the user profile and toggling the profile visibility (public/private).

Define a Follow model with fields for the follower and the followed user. Implement routes for following and unfollowing users, viewing the followers of a user, and viewing the users a user is following. Also, implement a route for viewing the timeline, which should display the posts from the users a user is following. After implementing the following and followers functionality, write tests to ensure that the following and followers functionality works correctly.", "7. **Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging functionality. Define a Message model with fields for the sender, the receiver, and the message content. Implement routes for sending messages, viewing the messages between two users, and blocking/unblocking users. After implementing the direct messaging functionality, write tests to ensure that the direct messaging functionality works correctly.", "8. **Notifications:** Implement the notifications functionality. Define a Notification model with fields for the user, the type of notification (like, retweet, reply, mention, new follower), and the related post or user. Implement a route for viewing the notifications of a user. After implementing the notifications functionality, write tests to ensure that the notifications functionality works correctly.", "9. **Trending Topics:** Implement the trending topics functionality. Define a Hashtag model with fields for the hashtag text and the posts that include the hashtag. Implement a route for viewing the trending hashtags, which should be sorted based on the number of mentions. After implementing the trending topics functionality, write tests to ensure that the trending topics functionality works correctly.", "10. **User Recommendations:** Implement the user recommendations functionality. Implement a route for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. The recommendation algorithm can be simple to start with, for example, recommending users who have the most followers or the most posts. After implementing the user recommendations functionality, write tests to ensure that the user recommendations functionality works correctly."], "step": "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication functionality. In the models.py file, define a User model with fields for email, username, and password. Implement a registration route in the routes.py file that allows users to register using their email, username, and password. Also, implement an authentication route that authenticates users and returns a JWT token. Use the Flask-JWT-Extended package for handling JWT tokens.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
