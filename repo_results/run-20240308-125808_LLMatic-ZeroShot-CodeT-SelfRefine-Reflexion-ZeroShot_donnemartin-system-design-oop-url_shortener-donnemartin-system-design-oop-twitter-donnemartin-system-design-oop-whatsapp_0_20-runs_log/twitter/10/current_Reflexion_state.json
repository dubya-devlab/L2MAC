This will help in identifying any issues early in the development process and will ensure that the code is robust and reliable. \n\nIn summary, the new plan should focus on implementing the core functionalities of the OMS, setting up a database, and writing comprehensive tests.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\n# Mock database\\nusers = {}\\nposts = {}\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass User:\\n\\tid: int\\n\\tusername: str\\n\\temail: str\\n\\tpassword: str\\n\\tprofile: dict\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass Post:\\n\\tid: int\\n\\tuser_id: int\\n\\tcontent: str\\n\\tlikes: int\\n\\tretweets: int\\n\\treplies: list\\n\\n@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])\\ndef register():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = User(len(users) + 1, data['username'], data['email'], data['password'], {})\\n\\tusers[user.id] = user\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'User registered successfully'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\\ndef login():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tfor user in users.values():\\n\\t\\tif user.username == data['username'] and user.password == data['password']:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Logged in successfully'}), 200\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Invalid username or password'}), 401\\n\\n@app.route('/post', methods=['POST'])\\ndef post():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tpost = Post(len(posts) + 1, data['user_id'], data['content'], 0, 0, [])\\n\\tposts[post.id] = post\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Post created successfully'}), 201\\n\\n@app.route('/like', methods=['POST'])\\ndef like():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tpost = posts.get(data['post_id'])\\n\\tif post:\\n\\t\\tpost.likes += 1\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Post liked'}), 200\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Post not found'}), 404\\n\\n@app.route('/retweet', methods=['POST'])\\ndef retweet():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tpost = posts.get(data['post_id'])\\n\\tif post:\\n\\t\\tpost.retweets += 1\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Post retweeted'}), 200\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Post not found'}), 404\\n\\n@app.route('/reply', methods=['POST'])\\ndef reply():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tpost = posts.get(data['post_id'])\\n\\tif post:\\n\\t\\tpost.replies.append(data['reply'])\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Reply added'}), 200\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message': 'Post not found'}), 404\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nfrom flask import json\\n\\n@pytest.fixture\\ndef client():\\n\\tapp.app.config['TESTING'] = True\\n\\twith app.app.test_client() as client:\\n\\t\\tyield client\\n\\n\\ndef test_register(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/register', json={'username': 'test', 'email': 'test@test.com', 'password': 'test'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert b'User registered successfully' in response.data\\n\\n\\ndef test_login(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/login', json={'username': 'test', 'password': 'test'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert b'Logged in successfully' in response.data\\n\\n\\ndef test_post(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/post', json={'user_id': 1, 'content': 'Hello, world!'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert b'Post created successfully' in response.data\\n\\n\\ndef test_like(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/like', json={'post_id': 1})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert b'Post liked' in response.data\\n\\n\\ndef test_retweet(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/retweet', json={'post_id': 1})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert b'Post retweeted' in response.data\\n\\n\\ndef test_reply(client):\\n\\tresponse = client.post('/reply', json={'post_id': 1, 'reply': 'Nice post!'})\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert b'Reply added' in response.data\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "name": "write_files"}, "role": "assistant"}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"All tests passed.\"}"}]}
