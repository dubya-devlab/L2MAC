Install the necessary dependencies such as Flask, pytest, and PyJWT. Write a test to ensure that the project setup is correct and the necessary dependencies are installed.", "2. **User Registration & Authentication:** Implement the user registration and authentication system. In the `models.py` file, define a User model with fields for email, username, and password. Implement the registration route in the `views.py` file that allows users to register with their email, username, and password. Implement the authentication route that checks the user's credentials and returns a JWT token if the credentials are correct. Write tests to ensure that the registration and authentication system works correctly.", "3. **User Profile Management:** Implement the user profile management system. Add fields to the User model for the profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Implement routes in the `views.py` file that allow users to view and edit their profile information. Add a field to the User model to indicate whether the profile is private or public. Write tests to ensure that the profile management system works correctly.", "4. **Posting & Content Management:** Implement the posting and content management system. Define a Post model in the `models.py` file with fields for the post content, images, and the user who created the post. Implement routes in the `views.py` file that allow users to create, view, and delete posts. Write tests to ensure that the posting system works correctly.", "5. **Interacting with Posts:** Implement the system for interacting with posts. Add fields to the Post model for likes, retweets, and replies. Implement routes in the `views.py` file that allow users to like, retweet, and reply to posts. Write tests to ensure that the interaction system works correctly.", "6. **Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the content filtering and search system. Implement a route in the `views.py` file that allows users to search for specific posts or users using keywords. Implement a filter option based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. Write tests to ensure that the filtering and search system works correctly.", "7. **Following & Followers:** Implement the system for following and followers. Add fields to the User model for the users that a user is following and the users that are following a user. Implement routes in the `views.py` file that allow users to follow and unfollow other users, and view the posts from the users they are following. Write tests to ensure that the following system works correctly.", "8. **Direct Messaging:** Implement the direct messaging system. Define a Message model in the `models.py` file with fields for the sender, receiver, and message content. Implement routes in the `views.py` file that allow users to send messages to other users and view their messages. Write tests to ensure that the messaging system works correctly.", "9. **Notifications:** Implement the notification system. Define a Notification model in the `models.py` file with fields for the user who will receive the notification, the user who triggered the notification, and the type of notification. Implement routes in the `views.py` file that allow users to view their notifications. Write tests to ensure that the notification system works correctly.", "10. **Trending & Discovery:** Implement the trending and discovery system. Implement a route in the `views.py` file that identifies and displays trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions. Implement a route that recommends users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. Write tests to ensure that the trending and discovery system works correctly."], "step": "7. **Following & Followers:** Implement the system for following and followers.

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass.
