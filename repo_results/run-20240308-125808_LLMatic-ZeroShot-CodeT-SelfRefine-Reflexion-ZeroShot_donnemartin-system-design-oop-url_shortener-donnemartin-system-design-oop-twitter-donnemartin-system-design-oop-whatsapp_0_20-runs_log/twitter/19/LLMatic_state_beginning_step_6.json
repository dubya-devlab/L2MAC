Implement methods for registering a new user (`register`), authenticating a user (`authenticate`), and resetting a user's password (`reset_password`). Use JWT or a similar protocol for secure authentication. For the password, store only a hashed version of it for security reasons. Use an in-memory dictionary to mock a database for storing user data. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_user.py` to test the `User` class methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Add methods to the `User` class for editing profile information. These methods should allow a user to update their profile picture (`update_profile_picture`), bio (`update_bio`), website link (`update_website_link`), and location (`update_location`). Also, implement a method for toggling the privacy of a user's profile (`toggle_privacy`). After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for these new methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "3. **Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Create a `Post` class in a file named `post.py`. This class should have attributes for `user` (the user who created the post), `content` (the text content of the post), `image` (an optional image included in the post), and `timestamp` (the time the post was created). Implement methods for creating a new post (`create`), and deleting a post (`delete`). The `create` method should ensure that the post content does not exceed 280 characters. Use an in-memory dictionary to mock a database for storing post data. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_post.py` to test the `Post` class methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Add methods to the `Post` class for liking a post (`like`), retweeting a post (`retweet`), and replying to a post (`reply`). The `like` and `retweet` methods should update a count of likes and retweets on the post, respectively. The `reply` method should create a new post that is linked to the original post. After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_post.py` to include tests for these new methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "5. **Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement a `Search` class in a file named `search.py`. This class should have methods for searching for posts or users by keyword (`search_by_keyword`), and filtering posts by hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics (`filter_posts`). The `search_by_keyword` method should return a list of posts and users that match the keyword. The `filter_posts` method should return a list of posts that match the specified filter criteria. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_search.py` to test the `Search` class methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Add methods to the `User` class for following another user (`follow`), unfollowing a user (`unfollow`), and viewing a timeline of posts from followed users (`view_timeline`). The `follow` and `unfollow` methods should update a list of followed users for the user. The `view_timeline` method should return a list of posts from the user's followed users. After implementing these methods, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for these new methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Implement a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender` (the user who sent the message), `receiver` (the user who received the message), `content` (the text content of the message), and `timestamp` (the time the message was sent). Implement methods for sending a message (`send`), and blocking/unblocking a user from sending messages (`block_user`, `unblock_user`). Use an in-memory dictionary to mock a database for storing message data. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_message.py` to test the `Message` class methods. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Add methods to the `User` class for receiving notifications of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions (`receive_notification`). The `receive_notification` method should update a list of notifications for the user. After implementing this method, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for this new method. Run the tests to ensure they pass.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `Trending` class in a file named `trending.py`. This class should have a method for identifying and displaying trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions (`get_trending_topics`). The `get_trending_topics` method should return a list of trending topics. After implementing this method, write a test file named `test_trending.py` to test the `Trending` class method. Run the test to ensure it passes.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Add a method to the `User` class for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers (`recommend_users`). The `recommend_users` method should return a list of recommended users. After implementing this method, update the tests in `test_user.py` to include tests for this new method. Run the tests to ensure they pass."], "step": "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Implement a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`.
