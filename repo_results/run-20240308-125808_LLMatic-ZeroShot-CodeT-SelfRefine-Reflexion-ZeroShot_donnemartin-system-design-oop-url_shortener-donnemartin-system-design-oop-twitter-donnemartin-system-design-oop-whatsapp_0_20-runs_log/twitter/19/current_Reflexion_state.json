First, in the login function, the token is being decoded immediately after being encoded which is causing an AttributeError. Second, in the post function, the token is not being decoded correctly which is causing an Unauthorized error. \n\nTo mitigate these issues, the plan would be to revise the code in the following way: \n\n1. In the login function, remove the decoding of the token immediately after it's encoded. The token should be sent as is to the client.\n2. In the post function, ensure that the token is being decoded correctly. This might involve checking the algorithm used for encoding and decoding the token, and making sure they match. Also, handle the case where the token is invalid or expired appropriately. \n\nBy addressing these issues, the code should be able to pass the tests successfully.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\\nfrom werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash\\nimport jwt\\nimport datetime\\nfrom functools import wraps\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\napp.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'thisissecret'\\n\\nusers = {}\\nsessions = {}\\n\\n\\ndef token_required(f):\\n\\t@wraps(f)\\n\\tdef decorated(*args, **kwargs):\\n\\t\\ttoken = None\\n\\t\\tif 'x-access-token' in request.headers:\\n\\t\\t\\ttoken = request.headers['x-access-token']\\n\\t\\tif not token:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message' : 'Token is missing!'}), 401\\n\\t\\ttry:\\n\\t\\t\\tdata = jwt.decode(token, app.config['SECRET_KEY'])\\n\\t\\t\\tcurrent_user = sessions.get(data['username'])\\n\\t\\texcept:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message' : 'Token is invalid!'}), 401\\n\\t\\treturn f(current_user, *args, **kwargs)\\n\\treturn decorated\\n\\n\\n@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])\\n\\ndef register():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\thashed_password = generate_password_hash(data['password'], method='sha256')\\n\\tusers[data['username']] = {'password': hashed_password}\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message' : 'New user registered!'}), 201\\n\\n\\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\\n\\ndef login():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users.get(data['username'])\\n\\tif not user or not check_password_hash(user['password'], data['password']):\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message' : 'Login failed!'}), 401\\n\\ttoken = jwt.encode({'username' : data['username'], 'exp' : datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)}, app.config['SECRET_KEY'])\\n\\tsessions[data['username']] = {'token': token}\\n\\treturn jsonify({'token' : token.decode('UTF-8')}), 200\\n\\n\\n@app.route('/post', methods=['POST'])\\n@token_required\\ndef post(current_user):\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tcurrent_user['posts'] = current_user.get('posts', []) + [data['post']]\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message' : 'New post created!'}), 201\\n\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nimport jwt\\n\\n\\ndef test_register():\\n\\tresponse = app.register()\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message' : 'New user registered!'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_login():\\n\\tresponse = app.login()\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert 'token' in response.get_json()\\n\\n\\ndef test_post():\\n\\tresponse = app.post()\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message' : 'New post created!'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_token_required():\\n\\tresponse = app.post()\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 401\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message' : 'Token is missing!'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_invalid_token():\\n\\tapp.app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'wrongsecret'\\n\\ttoken = jwt.encode({'username' : 'test', 'exp' : datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)}, app.app.config['SECRET_KEY'])\\n\\tapp.request.headers['x-access-token'] = token\\n\\tresponse = app.post()\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 401\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message' : 'Token is invalid!'}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "name": "write_files"}, "role": "assistant"}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.

The platform provides features for both individual users and administrative management.\n\n**Functional Requirements to implement**:\n\n1. **User Management:**\n    1. **Registration & Authentication:**  \n        - [ ] Allow users to register using email, username, and password.\n        - [ ] Option to reset forgotten passwords.\n        - [ ] Secure authentication using JWT or similar protocols.\n    2. **Profile Management:**  \n        - [ ] Users can edit their profile information: profile picture, bio, website link, and location.\n        - [ ] Option to make profile private or public.\n\n2. **Posting & Content Management:**\n    1. **Creating Posts (Tweets):**  \n        - [ ] Allow users to create text-based posts with a limit of 280 characters.\n        - [ ] Option to include images in posts.\n        - [ ] Users can delete their own posts.\n    2. **Interacting with Posts:**  \n        - [ ] Users can like, retweet, and reply to posts.\n        - [ ] Nested comment structure for post replies.\n    3. **Content Filtering & Search:**  \n        - [ ] Users can search for specific posts or users using keywords.\n        - [ ] Filter option based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics.\n\n3. **Social Interaction:**\n    1. **Following & Followers:**  \n        - [ ] Users can follow/unfollow other users.\n        - [ ] A timeline view displays posts from followed users.\n        - [ ] Users receive notifications for new followers.\n    2. **Direct Messaging:**  \n        - [ ] Private conversation threads between users.\n        - [ ] Option to block/unblock users from messaging.\n    3. **Notifications:**  \n        - [ ] Users are notified of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions.\n\n4. **Trending & Discovery:**\n    1. **Trending Topics:**  \n        - [ ] System identifies and displays trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions.\n        - [ ] Trending topics can be sorted based on location or globally.\n    2. **User Recommendations:**  \n        - [ ] Recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers.\n```\n\nThe failure in the generated code seems to be due to a couple of issues. First, in the login function, the token is being decoded immediately after being encoded which is causing an AttributeError. Second, in the post function, the token is not being decoded correctly which is causing an Unauthorized error. \n\nTo mitigate these issues, the plan would be to revise the code in the following way: \n\n1. In the login function, remove the decoding of the token immediately after it's encoded. The token should be sent as is to the client.\n2. In the post function, ensure that the token is being decoded correctly. This might involve checking the algorithm used for encoding and decoding the token, and making sure they match. Also, handle the case where the token is invalid or expired appropriately. \n\nBy addressing these issues, the code should be able to pass the tests successfully.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\\nfrom werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash\\nimport jwt\\nimport datetime\\nfrom functools import wraps\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\napp.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'thisissecret'\\n\\nusers = {}\\nsessions = {}\\n\\n\\ndef token_required(f):\\n\\t@wraps(f)\\n\\tdef decorated(*args, **kwargs):\\n\\t\\ttoken = None\\n\\t\\tif 'x-access-token' in request.headers:\\n\\t\\t\\ttoken = request.headers['x-access-token']\\n\\t\\tif not token:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message' : 'Token is missing!'}), 401\\n\\t\\ttry:\\n\\t\\t\\tdata = jwt.decode(token, app.config['SECRET_KEY'])\\n\\t\\t\\tcurrent_user = sessions.get(data['username'])\\n\\t\\texcept:\\n\\t\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message' : 'Token is invalid!'}), 401\\n\\t\\treturn f(current_user, *args, **kwargs)\\n\\treturn decorated\\n\\n\\n@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])\\n\\ndef register():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\thashed_password = generate_password_hash(data['password'], method='sha256')\\n\\tusers[data['username']] = {'password': hashed_password}\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message' : 'New user registered!'}), 201\\n\\n\\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\\n\\ndef login():\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tuser = users.get(data['username'])\\n\\tif not user or not check_password_hash(user['password'], data['password']):\\n\\t\\treturn jsonify({'message' : 'Login failed!'}), 401\\n\\ttoken = jwt.encode({'username' : data['username'], 'exp' : datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)}, app.config['SECRET_KEY'])\\n\\tsessions[data['username']] = {'token': token}\\n\\treturn jsonify({'token' : token.decode('UTF-8')}), 200\\n\\n\\n@app.route('/post', methods=['POST'])\\n@token_required\\ndef post(current_user):\\n\\tdata = request.get_json()\\n\\tcurrent_user['posts'] = current_user.get('posts', []) + [data['post']]\\n\\treturn jsonify({'message' : 'New post created!'}), 201\\n\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n\\tapp.run(debug=True)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"file_path\": \"test_app.py\",\n      \"file_contents\": \"import pytest\\nimport app\\nimport jwt\\n\\n\\ndef test_register():\\n\\tresponse = app.register()\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message' : 'New user registered!'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_login():\\n\\tresponse = app.login()\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 200\\n\\tassert 'token' in response.get_json()\\n\\n\\ndef test_post():\\n\\tresponse = app.post()\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 201\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message' : 'New post created!'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_token_required():\\n\\tresponse = app.post()\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 401\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message' : 'Token is missing!'}\\n\\n\\ndef test_invalid_token():\\n\\tapp.app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'wrongsecret'\\n\\ttoken = jwt.encode({'username' : 'test', 'exp' : datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)}, app.app.config['SECRET_KEY'])\\n\\tapp.request.headers['x-access-token'] = token\\n\\tresponse = app.post()\\n\\tassert response.status_code == 401\\n\\tassert response.get_json() == {'message' : 'Token is invalid!'}\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "name": "write_files"}, "role": "assistant"}, {"role": "function", "name": "write_files", "content": "{\"write_files_status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"write_files completed successfully.
