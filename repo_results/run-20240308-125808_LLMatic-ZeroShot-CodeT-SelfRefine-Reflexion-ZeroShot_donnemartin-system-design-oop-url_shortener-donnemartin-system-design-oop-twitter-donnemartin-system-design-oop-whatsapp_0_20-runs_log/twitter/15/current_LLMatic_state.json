This class should have attributes for `email`, `username`, `password`, and `is_private` (for profile privacy). Implement methods for registering a new user (`register`), authenticating a user (`authenticate`), and resetting a user's password (`reset_password`). Use a dictionary to mock a database for storing user data. The `register` method should check if a user with the given email or username already exists before adding a new user. The `authenticate` method should verify the user's credentials. The `reset_password` method should update the user's password. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_user.py` to verify that the `User` class methods work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "2. **User Management - Profile Management:** Extend the `User` class by adding attributes for `profile_picture`, `bio`, `website_link`, and `location`. Implement methods for editing these profile attributes (`edit_profile`). The `edit_profile` method should update the user's profile information. After implementing this method, write tests in `test_user.py` to verify that the `edit_profile` method works as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "3. **Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Create a `Post` class in a file named `post.py`. This class should have attributes for `user`, `text`, `image`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for creating a new post (`create_post`) and deleting a post (`delete_post`). The `create_post` method should create a new post and add it to a mock database (a dictionary). The `delete_post` method should remove a post from the mock database. After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_post.py` to verify that the `Post` class methods work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Extend the `Post` class by adding attributes for `likes`, `retweets`, and `replies` (all initially empty lists). Implement methods for liking a post (`like_post`), retweeting a post (`retweet_post`), and replying to a post (`reply_post`). The `like_post` method should add a user to the post's `likes` list. The `retweet_post` method should add a user to the post's `retweets` list. The `reply_post` method should add a reply (another `Post` instance) to the post's `replies` list. After implementing these methods, write tests in `test_post.py` to verify that these new `Post` class methods work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "5. **Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement a `search` function in `post.py` that takes a keyword and returns a list of posts that contain the keyword in their text. Implement a `filter_posts` function that takes a hashtag, user mention, or trending topic and returns a list of posts that contain the given filter in their text. After implementing these functions, write tests in `test_post.py` to verify that the `search` and `filter_posts` functions work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Extend the `User` class by adding attributes for `following` and `followers` (both initially empty lists). Implement methods for following a user (`follow_user`), unfollowing a user (`unfollow_user`), and viewing a timeline of posts from followed users (`view_timeline`). The `follow_user` method should add a user to the current user's `following` list and add the current user to the other user's `followers` list. The `unfollow_user` method should remove a user from the current user's `following` list and remove the current user from the other user's `followers` list. The `view_timeline` method should return a list of posts from users that the current user is following. After implementing these methods, write tests in `test_user.py` to verify that these new `User` class methods work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Create a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender`, `receiver`, `text`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for sending a message (`send_message`) and blocking a user from sending messages (`block_user`). The `send_message` method should create a new message and add it to a mock database (a dictionary). The `block_user` method should add a user to the current user's `blocked_users` list (a new attribute in the `User` class). After implementing these methods, write tests in a file named `test_message.py` to verify that the `Message` class methods work as expected. Run these tests using pytest.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Implement a `Notification` class in a file named `notification.py`. This class should have attributes for `user`, `type` (like, retweet, reply, mention, or new follower), `post` (if applicable), and `timestamp`.
