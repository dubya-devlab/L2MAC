The endpoints and database models have been defined, but the logic for each endpoint is missing. The tests are also placeholders and do not test any functionality.\n\nTo improve this, the plan would be to:\n\n1. Implement the logic for each endpoint in the Flask application. This includes registration, authentication, profile management, post creation, post interaction, following/unfollowing users, direct messaging, trending topics, and user recommendations.\n\n2. Update the database models as necessary to support the required features. This may include adding new models or modifying existing ones.\n\n3. Write comprehensive tests for each endpoint to ensure that they function as expected. This includes both success and failure cases.\n\n4. Run the tests and debug any issues that arise. Continue this process until all tests pass.\n\nOnly output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.\n"}, {"content": null, "function_call": {"arguments": "\n{\n  \"files_and_contents\": [\n
