The project will be structured in a modular way, with separate modules for user management, posting & content management, social interaction, and trending & discovery. Each module will have its own Python file, and there will be a main file that brings everything together. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the project structure is set up correctly and run these tests.", "2. **Implement User Management - Registration & Authentication:** Implement the functionality for users to register using email, username, and password. This will involve creating a User class with attributes for email, username, and password, and methods for registering a new user and authenticating an existing user. Also, implement the option for users to reset their forgotten passwords. For secure authentication, use JWT or a similar protocol. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can register, authenticate, and reset their passwords correctly, and run these tests.", "3. **Implement User Management - Profile Management:** Implement the functionality for users to edit their profile information, including profile picture, bio, website link, and location. Also, implement the option for users to make their profile private or public. This will involve adding more attributes to the User class and methods for editing these attributes. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can edit their profile information and change their profile privacy settings correctly, and run these tests.", "4. **Implement Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Implement the functionality for users to create text-based posts with a limit of 280 characters, include images in posts, and delete their own posts. This will involve creating a Post class with attributes for the post content, images, and the user who created the post, and methods for creating and deleting posts. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can create, include images in, and delete posts correctly, and run these tests.", "5. **Implement Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Implement the functionality for users to like, retweet, and reply to posts, and for posts to have a nested comment structure for replies. This will involve adding more methods to the Post class for liking, retweeting, and replying to posts, and creating a Comment class for the replies. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can like, retweet, and reply to posts correctly, and that posts have a correct nested comment structure for replies, and run these tests.", "6. **Implement Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement the functionality for users to search for specific posts or users using keywords, and to filter posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics. This will involve adding more methods to the Post and User classes for searching and filtering. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can search for posts and users, and filter posts correctly, and run these tests.", "7. **Implement Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Implement the functionality for users to follow/unfollow other users, for a timeline view to display posts from followed users, and for users to receive notifications for new followers. This will involve adding more methods to the User class for following and unfollowing users, and creating a Timeline class for the timeline view. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can follow/unfollow other users, that the timeline view displays posts from followed users correctly, and that users receive notifications for new followers correctly, and run these tests.", "8. **Implement Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Implement the functionality for private conversation threads between users, and for users to block/unblock other users from messaging. This will involve creating a Message class for the messages and adding more methods to the User class for blocking and unblocking users. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users can have private conversation threads and block/unblock other users from messaging correctly, and run these tests.", "9. **Implement Social Interaction - Notifications:** Implement the functionality for users to be notified of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions. This will involve creating a Notification class for the notifications and adding more methods to the User and Post classes for creating notifications. After implementing this functionality, write tests to ensure that users are notified of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions correctly, and run these tests.", "10. **Implement Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics & User Recommendations:** Implement the functionality for the system to identify and display trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions, for trending topics to be sorted based on location or globally, and for the system to recommend users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers. This will involve creating a TrendingTopic class for the trending topics and adding more methods to the User and Post classes for recommending users.
