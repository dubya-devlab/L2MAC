After implementing these methods, update the `test_user.py` file to include tests for these new methods. Run these tests using pytest to ensure they all pass.", "3. **Posting & Content Management - Creating Posts:** Create a `Post` class in a file named `post.py`. This class should have attributes for `user_id`, `text`, `image`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for creating a new post (`create_post`) and deleting a post (`delete_post`). The `create_post` method should enforce a character limit of 280 for the post text. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_post.py` to test the functionality of the `Post` class. Run these tests using pytest to ensure they all pass.", "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Add methods to the `Post` class for liking a post (`like_post`), retweeting a post (`retweet_post`), and replying to a post (`reply_to_post`). The `reply_to_post` method should support a nested comment structure. After implementing these methods, update the `test_post.py` file to include tests for these new methods. Run these tests using pytest to ensure they all pass.", "5. **Posting & Content Management - Content Filtering & Search:** Implement a `Search` class in a file named `search.py`. This class should have methods for searching for specific posts or users using keywords (`search_posts`, `search_users`) and filtering posts based on hashtags, user mentions, or trending topics (`filter_posts`). After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_search.py` to test the functionality of the `Search` class. Run these tests using pytest to ensure they all pass.", "6. **Social Interaction - Following & Followers:** Add methods to the `User` class for following a user (`follow_user`), unfollowing a user (`unfollow_user`), and viewing a timeline of posts from followed users (`view_timeline`). The `view_timeline` method should display posts in chronological order. After implementing these methods, update the `test_user.py` file to include tests for these new methods. Run these tests using pytest to ensure they all pass.", "7. **Social Interaction - Direct Messaging:** Implement a `Message` class in a file named `message.py`. This class should have attributes for `sender_id`, `receiver_id`, `text`, and `timestamp`. Implement methods for sending a message (`send_message`) and blocking a user from sending messages (`block_user`). After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_message.py` to test the functionality of the `Message` class. Run these tests using pytest to ensure they all pass.", "8. **Social Interaction - Notifications:** Add methods to the `User` class for receiving notifications of likes, retweets, replies, and mentions (`receive_notification`). Implement a `Notification` class in a file named `notification.py` with attributes for `user_id`, `type` (like, retweet, reply, mention), and `timestamp`. After implementing these methods and classes, write a test file named `test_notification.py` to test the functionality of the `Notification` class and the new `User` method. Run these tests using pytest to ensure they all pass.", "9. **Trending & Discovery - Trending Topics:** Implement a `Trending` class in a file named `trending.py`. This class should have methods for identifying and displaying trending hashtags or topics based on volume and velocity of mentions (`get_trending_topics`). The `get_trending_topics` method should support sorting based on location or globally. After implementing these methods, write a test file named `test_trending.py` to test the functionality of the `Trending` class. Run these tests using pytest to ensure they all pass.", "10. **Trending & Discovery - User Recommendations:** Add a method to the `User` class for recommending users to follow based on interests, activity, and mutual followers (`recommend_users`). After implementing this method, update the `test_user.py` file to include a test for this new method. Run this test using pytest to ensure it passes."], "step": "4. **Posting & Content Management - Interacting with Posts:** Add methods to the `Post` class for liking a post (`like_post`), retweeting a post (`retweet_post`), and replying to a post (`reply_to_post`).

Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step.
