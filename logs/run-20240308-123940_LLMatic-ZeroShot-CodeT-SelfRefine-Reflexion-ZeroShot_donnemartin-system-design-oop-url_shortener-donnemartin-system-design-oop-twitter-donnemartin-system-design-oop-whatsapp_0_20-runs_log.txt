Objective: Write code for a large system design task.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.
Only use the functions you have been provided with.
Only use the `write_files` to output code.

You must act autonomously and you will receive no human input at any stage. You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.
You always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.
Please always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.
When writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.

Provide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.

You cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.

You cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.
                               
If a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.

Use the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.

You will get instructions for code to write.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.
Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
When writing code if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.

Useful to know:

For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.
You can use any package and any other packages you wish to install.
You cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persis between steps or write operations.
When writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.

### **Online URL Shortening Service**

**Overview**:
A service that allows users to submit long URLs and then receive a shortened version of that URL for ease of sharing.

**Functional Requirements to implement**:

1. **URL Shortening**:
   - [ ] 1.1. Users can input a URL to be shortened.
   - [ ] 1.2. The system validates that the URL is active and legitimate.
   - [ ] 1.3. The system generates a unique shortened URL.
   - [ ] 1.4. Users can choose custom short links (subject to availability).

2. **Redirection**:
   - [ ] 2.1. Accessing the shortened URL redirects to the original URL.

3. **Analytics**:
   - [ ] 3.1. Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs.
   - [ ] 3.2. View number of clicks.
   - [ ] 3.3. View date/time of each click.
   - [ ] 3.4. View geographical location of the clicker.

4. **User Accounts**:
   - [ ] 4.1. Users can create accounts.
   - [ ] 4.2. Account holders can view all their shortened URLs.
   - [ ] 4.3. Account holders can edit or delete their shortened URLs.
   - [ ] 4.4. Account holders can view analytics for all their shortened URLs.

5. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - [ ] 5.1. Administrators can view all shortened URLs.
   - [ ] 5.2. Administrators can delete any URL or user account.
   - [ ] 5.3. Administrators can monitor system performance and analytics.

6. **Expiration**:
   - [ ] 6.1. Users can set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL.
```

Understand the problem, by creating an extremely detailed step-by-step plan, where each step is long (multiple sentences) and in total includes every single feature requirement specified above, feel free to copy directly from it. Use no more than 10 steps in the plan. Create additional tests, checks and evaluation at each step when applicable to help make an excellent code implementation, where all the code is fully functional. Use best software design practices, and you can output large amounts of code at once. Please include a last sentence to create and run tests when implementing or writing code in that same step. You will receive no human input at any stage, so you cannot use a human to test. Only create a detailed plan to begin with, which includes designing and running tests to check that they all pass. Please be sure to include all of the specified feature requirements in the following plan.

  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Start by setting up the project structure and the necessary files. Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask for the web framework, pytest for testing, and requests for making HTTP requests to validate URLs. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.",

    "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `Shortener` class in a file named `shortener.py`. This class will have methods for validating URLs, generating short URLs, and storing the mapping between the original and short URLs in an in-memory dictionary. The `Shortener` class should also handle custom short URLs. After implementing the `Shortener` class, write tests to ensure that it can correctly validate URLs, generate unique short URLs, and store the URL mappings.",

    "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In the Flask application, add a route that matches the pattern of the short URLs. When this route is accessed, it should use the `Shortener` class to look up the original URL and redirect to it. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that accessing a short URL correctly redirects to the original URL.",

    "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Create an `Analytics` class in a file named `analytics.py`. This class will track the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker for each short URL. The `Analytics` class should store this data in an in-memory dictionary. After implementing the `Analytics` class, write tests to ensure that it can correctly track and retrieve the analytics data.",

    "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `User` class in a file named `user.py`. This class will handle user registration and authentication, and it will store the user data and their short URLs in an in-memory dictionary. After implementing the `User` class, write tests to ensure that users can register, authenticate, and manage their short URLs.",

    "Step 6: Extend the `Shortener` and `User` classes to allow users to edit or delete their shortened URLs. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that users can correctly edit or delete their short URLs.",

    "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `Admin` class in a file named `admin.py`. This class will have methods for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. After implementing the `Admin` class, write tests to ensure that it can correctly perform its functions.",

    "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration feature. Extend the `Shortener` class to allow users to set an expiration date/time for their short URLs. The class should automatically delete the URL mapping when it expires. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the URL expiration works correctly.",

    "Step 9: Integrate all the features in the Flask application. Add routes for user registration and authentication, URL shortening, redirection, analytics viewing, and admin dashboard. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application works as expected.",

    "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application. Run all the tests written in the previous steps to ensure that all features are working correctly. Also, write additional tests if necessary to cover any edge cases or scenarios that were not covered in the previous tests."

Objective: Write code for a large system design task.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.
Only use the functions you have been provided with.
Only use the `write_files` to output code.

You must act autonomously and you will receive no human input at any stage. You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.
You always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.
Please always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.
When writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.

Provide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.

You cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.

You cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.
                               
If a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.

Use the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.

Only use the `write_files` to output code.

You must act autonomously and you will receive no human input at any stage. You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.
You always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.
Please always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.
When writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.

Provide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.

You cannot visualize any graphical output. You exist within a Actor Model machine, and when you list out steps, each step will be taken by a new separate sub-ChatGPT model. When you list out a sub-task steps, you can optionally specify the sub-task validation to check that it has been completed successfully.

You cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.
                               
If a test is failing the error could be the code, or the test is incorrect, so feel free to overwrite and change the tests when they are incorrect, to make all tests pass.

Only use the functions you have been provided with, and if you want to output code only use the `write_files` function to output code. Condition it on existing code: ['app.py', 'requirements.txt', 'test_app.py', 'shortener.py', 'test_shortener.py', 'analytics.py', 'test_analytics.py', 'user.py', 'test_user.py', 'admin.py', 'test_admin.py'] Fully implement these features in the code, no placeholders. If you have not viewed the files before writing to them, please view them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.
Respond now only with a function call of one of the following functions provided: `sub_task_step_complete`, `view_files`, `run_python_file`, `pytest_files`, `write_files`, `delete_files`, and if you want to output code only use the `write_files` function to output code.

Objective: Write code for a large system design task.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.
Only use the functions you have been provided with.
Only use the `write_files` to output code.

You must act autonomously and you will receive no human input at any stage. You have to return as output the complete code for completing this task, and correctly incorporate it into the existing code base.
You always write out the whole file contents. You always indent code with tabs.
Please always view the files before writing to them, to make sure you are writing to the correct files.
When writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.

Provide the minimal code necessary to achieve the task conditioned on the existing generated code---including changing the existing generated code.

You cannot visualize any graphical output.

You cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persist between steps or write operations.

Python toolbelt preferences:
- pytest
- dataclasses
- flask
                               
When writing code, do not make a single file long, instead split it into multiple files, such that each file can be separately tested.

Never use any time.sleep inside tests, instead if you want to use the passage of time in a test mock it only. All tests written should be fast to run and verify.
Use the functions provided. When calling functions only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON request following this format without deviation.

You will get instructions for code to write.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.
Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
When writing code if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.

Useful to know:

Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.
You can use any package and any other packages you wish to install.
You cannot use any databases as none are setup in the local environment, instead mock a database with an in memory dictionary to store data. No data saved to disk will persis between steps or write operations.
When writing a test, make the filename start with the prefix 'test_'.

Objective:```
### **Online URL Shortening Service**

**Overview**:
A service that allows users to submit long URLs and then receive a shortened version of that URL for ease of sharing.

**Functional Requirements to implement**:

1. **URL Shortening**:
   - [ ] 1.1. Users can input a URL to be shortened.
   - [ ] 1.2. The system validates that the URL is active and legitimate.
   - [ ] 1.3. The system generates a unique shortened URL.
   - [ ] 1.4. Users can choose custom short links (subject to availability).

2. **Redirection**:
   - [ ] 2.1. Accessing the shortened URL redirects to the original URL.

3. **Analytics**:
   - [ ] 3.1. Users can view statistics about their shortened URLs.
   - [ ] 3.2. View number of clicks.
   - [ ] 3.3. View date/time of each click.
   - [ ] 3.4. View geographical location of the clicker.

4. **User Accounts**:
   - [ ] 4.1. Users can create accounts.
   - [ ] 4.2. Account holders can view all their shortened URLs.
   - [ ] 4.3. Account holders can edit or delete their shortened URLs.
   - [ ] 4.4. Account holders can view analytics for all their shortened URLs.

5. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - [ ] 5.1. Administrators can view all shortened URLs.
   - [ ] 5.2. Administrators can delete any URL or user account.
   - [ ] 5.3. Administrators can monitor system performance and analytics.

6. **Expiration**:
   - [ ] 6.1. Users can set an expiration date/time for the shortened URL.
```

Only output all code now, which includes writing tests. Make this a long response. Create additional tests for the generated code, and make sure all the code generated is fully functional.
