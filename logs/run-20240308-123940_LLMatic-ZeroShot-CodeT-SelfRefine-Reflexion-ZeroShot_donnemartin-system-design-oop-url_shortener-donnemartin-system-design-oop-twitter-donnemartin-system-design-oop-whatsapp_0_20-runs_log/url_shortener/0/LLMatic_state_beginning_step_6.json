Create a Flask application in a file named `app.py`. This will serve as the entry point of the application. Also, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all the necessary Python packages. The packages will include Flask for the web framework, pytest for testing, and requests for making HTTP requests to validate URLs. After setting up the project structure, write tests to ensure that the Flask application is set up correctly and can run without errors.", "Step 2: Implement the URL shortening feature. Create a `Shortener` class in a file named `shortener.py`. This class will have methods for validating URLs, generating short URLs, and storing the mapping between the original and short URLs in an in-memory dictionary. The `Shortener` class should also handle custom short URLs. After implementing the `Shortener` class, write tests to ensure that it can correctly validate URLs, generate unique short URLs, and store the URL mappings.", "Step 3: Implement the redirection feature. In the Flask application, add a route that matches the pattern of the short URLs. When this route is accessed, it should use the `Shortener` class to look up the original URL and redirect to it. After implementing the redirection feature, write tests to ensure that accessing a short URL correctly redirects to the original URL.", "Step 4: Implement the analytics feature. Create an `Analytics` class in a file named `analytics.py`. This class will track the number of clicks, the date/time of each click, and the geographical location of the clicker for each short URL. The `Analytics` class should store this data in an in-memory dictionary. After implementing the `Analytics` class, write tests to ensure that it can correctly track and retrieve the analytics data.", "Step 5: Implement the user accounts feature. Create a `User` class in a file named `user.py`. This class will handle user registration and authentication, and it will store the user data and their short URLs in an in-memory dictionary. After implementing the `User` class, write tests to ensure that users can register, authenticate, and manage their short URLs.", "Step 6: Extend the `Shortener` and `User` classes to allow users to edit or delete their shortened URLs. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that users can correctly edit or delete their short URLs.", "Step 7: Implement the admin dashboard feature. Create an `Admin` class in a file named `admin.py`. This class will have methods for viewing all shortened URLs, deleting any URL or user account, and monitoring system performance and analytics. After implementing the `Admin` class, write tests to ensure that it can correctly perform its functions.", "Step 8: Implement the URL expiration feature. Extend the `Shortener` class to allow users to set an expiration date/time for their short URLs. The class should automatically delete the URL mapping when it expires. After implementing this feature, write tests to ensure that the URL expiration works correctly.", "Step 9: Integrate all the features in the Flask application. Add routes for user registration and authentication, URL shortening, redirection, analytics viewing, and admin dashboard. After integrating all the features, write tests to ensure that the application works as expected.", "Step 10: Finally, perform a comprehensive testing of the entire application. Run all the tests written in the previous steps to ensure that all features are working correctly.
